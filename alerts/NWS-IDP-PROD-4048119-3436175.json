Cold and dry air in place across the\nregion ahead of this system will support snowfall as the\nprecipitation continues to overspread the area from the west-\nsouthwest through the later morning hours. The highest snow\naccumulations will likely occur near the junction of the Georgia,\nNorth Carolina, and South Carolina borders in the extreme southern\nAppalachians.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches,\nwith local 5 inch amounts near the North Carolina border.\n\n* WHERE...Rabun and Habersham Counties in extreme northeast\nGeorgia and Macon County in western North Carolina.\n\n* WHEN...From 6 AM this morning to 7 PM EST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Accumulating snow on area roadways, and reduced\nvisibility in snow, could make travel very difficult.",
