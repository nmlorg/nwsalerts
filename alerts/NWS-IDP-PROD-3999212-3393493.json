For the Small Craft Advisory,\nnortheast winds 10 to 20 knots with gusts up to 30 knots and\nwaves 6 to 9 feet expected.\n\n* WHERE...Oak Point to Saxon Harbor WI.\n\n* WHEN...From 4 AM Saturday to 4 PM CST Sunday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
