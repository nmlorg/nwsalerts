This band\nextended from near Cumberland to Front Royal to Culpeper as of\n5 AM. Visibility below one mile and a quick coating of snow is\nlikely with this band. Snow will only last about an hour or so in\nany one given location, but given the snowfall rates and cold\nground and road temperatures, snow will stick to all untreated\nsurfaces. Remain alert for icy roadways if traveling early this\nmorning.",
