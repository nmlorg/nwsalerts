        "description": "...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT BEGINNING THIS AFTERNOON AS HEAVY RAIN\nRETURNS TO THE AREA...\n\n.A stalled frontal boundary will bring moderate to heavy rainfall\nto the southwest North Carolina mountains, parts of northeast\nGeorgia, and far western Upstate South Carolina beginning this\nafternoon. With the ground saturated from heavy rainfall last\nweek, and rivers still running high, flooding impacts are\npossible in areas that see more heavy rain this afternoon through\nearly Tuesday.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has\nexpanded the\n\n* Flood Watch to include a portion of upstate South Carolina,\nincluding the following areas, Anderson, Greater Greenville,\nand Greenville Mountains.\n\n* through Tuesday evening\n\n* Rainfall amounts of 1.5 to 2.5 inches, with locally higher\namounts are expected from this afternoon through Tuesday, which\nmay lead to new flooding and worsen conditions in areas that\nhave not yet recovered from flooding last week. Saturated ground\nand continued high river and stream levels may lead to flooding\ndeveloping quickly.\n\n* Rapid rises above bankfull on streams and creeks may occur,\nalong with the threat of flooded roadways. Flooding is also\nlikely to re-develop on larger rivers. The heavy rainfall will\nalso greatly increase the risk of landslides.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
