        "description": "Repeated periods of rainfall over the last several weeks has\nincreased soil moisture to high levels across western Washington.\nModerate rainfall of up to an inch and a half on Wednesday is\nexpected. This amount of rain will put extra pressure on soil\ninstability, leading to an increased threat of landslides being\ntriggered. This will mostly affect the coast and foothills.\n\nA number of landslides have already been reported in various\nlocations in western Washington over the last week during or right\nafter the rainstorms that have occurred. More landslides are\npossible.\n\nAreas above about 4000 feet in elevation will see mostly snow and\nnot be affected.\n\nFor more information about current conditions, visit\nwww.weather.gov/seattle, select Hydrology, and then scroll down\nfor the links to the landslide information pages.\n\nFor more information on landslides, visit the website for the\nWashington State Department of Natural Resources landslide\ngeologic hazards at: http://bit.ly/2mtA3wn",
