        "description": "At 230 PM EST, the heavy rainfall that resulted in 1-2 inches of\naccumulation across Chester, Union, and York counties this morning\nended abruptly as stronger thunderstorms developed south and east of\nthe area. Fortunately, these thunderstorms intercepted the abundant\nmoisture streaming into the region and caused the ongoing moderate\nshowers across the area to end. Several area streams are just now\ncresting from the excessive runoff so the Flood Advisory will be\ncontinued to allow area streams to crest and begin their recession.\n\nOnly light showers are expected through this afternoon and early\nevening; therefore, any nuisance flooding from the heavy rainfall\nthat occurred this morning is expected to diminish by the time the\nFlood Advisory expires later this afternoon.\n\nAdditional rounds of rainfall over saturated soils are expected\ntonight through early tomorrow morning which may cause new flooding\nto develop. People in Chester, Union, and York counties are advised\nto stay weather aware.\n\nSome locations that may continue to experience nuisance flooding\ninclude...\nRock Hill, Union, Chester, Fort Mill, Tega Cay, Newport, Lesslie,\nGreat Falls, Monarch Mill and Buffalo.",
        "instruction": "Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nA Flood Advisory means river or stream flows are elevated, or ponding\nof water in urban or other areas is likely.",
