Strong north\nto northeast winds gusting up to 40 to 50 mph will build waves\nto 12 to 16 feet with occasional waves up to 20 feet.\n\n* WHERE...The shoreline areas of Cook and Lake Counties in\nIllinois and Lake and Porter Counties in indiana.\n\n* WHEN...Late Friday night through late Saturday night.\n\n* IMPACTS...The winds and large battering waves combined with near\nrecord high lake levels could exacerbate already significant\nbeach and shoreline erosion sustained in the past several\nmonths. Vulnerable structures along the shore may be heavily\ndamaged. In addition, flood prone paths and roads along the\nlake will be susceptible to lengthy closures due to the expected\nlong duration of high winds and waves.",
