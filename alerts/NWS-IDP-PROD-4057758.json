        "description": "A \"flash freeze\" has occurred on roadways in northwest Arkansas\nand portions of neighboring northeast Oklahoma. A period of snow\nflurries occurred earlier this morning, and was heavy enough to\ndeposit moisture on roadways. An arctic front has moved thru the\nregion, dropping temps well below freezing and allowing this\nmoisture to freeze on the elevated bridges and overpasses. The\nresulting slick spots have caused several accidents on I-49 this\nmorning. Conditions will improve once the sun rises and is able to\nwarm the road surfaces. Until then, drive with caution.",
