In west central Washington, King, Lewis,\nPierce, Snohomish, and Thurston.\n\n* From Thursday afternoon through Friday afternoon\n\n* A period of warming, rising snow levels, and heavy rain in the\nmountains will force sharp rises on the rivers flowing off the\nCascades. Snow levels will rise to around 5,000 to 7,000 feet\nwith 3 to 6 inches of rain in the mountains late Wednesday\nthrough Saturday. Locally heavier amounts are possible. Minor\nflooding is possible on several rivers as a result.",
