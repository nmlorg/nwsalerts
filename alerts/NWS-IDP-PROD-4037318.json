        "description": "A slow-moving cold front will combine with several upper level\ndisturbances crossing the region to produce waves of moderate\nrainfall from early this morning and continuing through early\nThursday. Areal average rainfall totals over south central\nKentucky likely will range from 3 to 4 inches. Areas that see the\nmore persistent heavier rainfall likely would see higher amounts.\n\nThe first wave of rain is ongoing...but the ground should be able\nto soak in this rain well. Additional rains will form later this\nafternoon and night, with more waves Wednesday and Wednesday\nnight. During these periods ponding of roadways is possible with\nminor flooding not out of the question. Most area rivers and\ncreeks look to handle this rainfall well, but a few could reach\nminor flood stage...particularly along the Green River at Woodbury\nand Rochester. The Rolling Fork River near Boston will come close\nto flood stage...depending on just how far north the heaviest\nrainfall gets.\n\nStay tuned to the latest forecast updates over the next few days.",
