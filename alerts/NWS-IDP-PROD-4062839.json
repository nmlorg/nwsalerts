Gusts as high as 70 mph are likely Monday night. For the\nrest of Anchorage and much of the Matanuska Valley, gusty east to\nsoutheast winds of 20 to 35 mph will arrive Monday night. These\nwinds will cause temperatures across the area to jump above\nfreezing, possibly reaching the upper 30s to lower 40s. Winds are\nexpected to then die down during the day Tuesday, with\ntemperatures cooling back down to freezing or below. As\ntemperatures cool, the threat for accumulating snow will increase\non Tuesday as well.\n\nThere is still some uncertainty with the track and strength of\nthe storm system causing these winds.
