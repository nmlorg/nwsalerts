        "description": "* The next in a series of winter storms will affect the region\nFriday overnight into Saturday. Light snow showers with travel\nimpacts are expected over the Sierra and northeast California,\nhowever the main story will likely be wind. Strong gusty\nsouthwest winds will probably bring travel impacts to wind prone\nareas such as Washoe Valley and along Highway 395 in Mono\nCounty. Rough air can also be expected for flying.\n\n* A few snow showers are possible Sunday into Monday with the best\nchance of travel impacts over the northern Sierra passes and\nnortheast California. The next significant storm hits the region\nMonday night into Tuesday. This storm has potential for both\nwidespread strong gusty winds especially in far western Nevada\nand heavy mountain snowfall. Snow accumulation is possible in\nwestern Nevada but less certain as usual.\n\n* Wednesday night into Thursday next week continues to showcase\nthe strongest storm of the sequence. Current indications show\nwidespread heavy snowfall for both mountains and western Nevada\nvalleys, along with high wind potential for most areas. This\nscenario would be quite disruptive for travel in the region,\nbut since we're still 6-7 days out things of course can change.\n\n* Anyone with road or air travel plans over the coming week should\nkeep a close eye on the forecast. Disruptions and delays are\npossible from these storms. For road condition information check\nwith NDOT or Caltrans or your favorite mapping app.",
