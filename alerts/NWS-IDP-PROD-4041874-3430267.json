With the expected additional rainfall, the river will\nlikely crest near 13 feet, but could rise as high as 15 feet this\nafternoon if expected rainfall amounts over perform. If this were to\noccur, this would be the highest readings since November of 2003 or\nearlier.\n\nSome locations that will experience flooding include...\nMarion...\nRichlands...\nBluefield...\nTazewell...\nand Saltville.",
