        "description": "At 1254 PM EST, a snow squall was located along a line extending from\nnear Port Jervis to Greeley to Scranton. Movement was southeast at\n50 mph. The squall likely will begin as rain in the lower elevations\nand change to a burst of brief heavy snow 10 to 15 minutes after the\nonset. Road surface temperatures in northeast Pennsylvania and\nSullivan County New York were generally above freezing. The best\nchance for rapidly changing road conditions from wet to snowy and\nslippery will be over the higher terrain.\n\nWinds in excess of 40 mph are possible with this squall.\n\nThis squall will be near...\nShohola and Greeley around 100 PM EST.\nPort Jervis and Sterling around 110 PM EST.\nMatamoras and Angels around 115 PM EST.\n\nUse extra caution if you must travel into or through this dangerous\nsnow squall. Rapid changes in visibility and potentially slick roads\nare likely to lead to accidents. Consider delaying travel until the\nsquall passes your location.",
