        "description": "* WHAT...Periods of southerly wind 25 to 35 kt are expected\nthrough Wednesday. Wind driven seas will combine with westerly\nswell to produce steep to very steep seas of 10 to 18 ft through\nThursday, peaking in the 14 to 18 ft range Sunday night through\nMonday night. Winds are likely to reach gale force 35 to 40\nknots over a portion of the area late Monday morning through\nTuesday morning.\n\n* WHERE...The Small Craft Advisory is for all areas. The Hazardous\nSeas Warning is in effect north of Brookings from the coast out\nto 60 NM, with wave conditions expected to become less steep\nwith time this morning from southwest to northeast. The Gale\nWatch is for areas north of Gold Beach to Florence between the\ncoast to about 30 NM west of the coast.\n\n* WHEN...For the Hazardous Seas Warning, until 4 AM PST early\nthis morning. For the Small Craft Advisory, until 10 PM PST\nThursday. For the Gale Watch, from Monday morning through late\nMonday night.\n\n* IMPACTS...Steep seas will make conditions difficult to hazardous\nfor small craft. Very steep seas could damage or even capsize\nsmall vessels. Gales late Monday morning through Tuesday morning will\ncreate very steep seas which could capsize or damage vessels in\nthe Gale Watch area. Low visibility conditions are expected at\ntimes.\n\n* View the hazard area in detail at\nhttps://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mfr/HAZARD",
        "instruction": "Mariners should consider altering plans to avoid strong winds and\nvery steep seas. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course,\nand/or secure the vessel for severe conditions.\n\nA Small Craft Advisory means that winds and seas will create a\npotential hazard to smaller vessels and inexperienced mariners.\n\nA Hazardous Seas Warning means very steep and hazardous sea\nconditions are imminent or occurring. Recreational boaters should\nremain in port, or take shelter until waves subside.  Commercial\nvessels should prepare for rough seas and consider remaining in\nport or taking shelter in port until hazardous seas subside.\n\nA Gale Watch is issued when the risk of gale force winds of 34 to\n47 knots has significantly increased, but the specific timing\nand/or location is still uncertain. It is intended to provide\nadditional lead time for mariners who may wish to consider\naltering their plans.",
