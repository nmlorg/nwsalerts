        "description": "A storm system will bring much colder temperatures, high winds,\nand snow to the Land of Enchantment on Monday and Tuesday. Strong\nto damaging southwest winds will arrive first, and impact areas\nnear and south of I-40 as well as the Chuska Mountains in western\nNew Mexico. Gusts between 50 and 60 mph are possible atop the\nhigh terrain, tapering off Monday night. Windy conditions with\ngusts upwards of 40 to 50 mph will also reach down to portions of\neastern New Mexico. Crosswinds will be a main concern for any high\nprofile vehicles.\n\nSnow will favor northern and western New Mexico Monday afternoon\nthrough Tuesday. The heaviest snow amounts are expected across the\nnorthern mountains where up to 10 inches of snow is possible. A\ndusting to an inch or two will be possible for lower elevations\nof the west and north. Light snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches\nwill be possible through eastern New Mexico late Tuesday through\nTuesday night, with locally higher amounts of 6 to 8 inches atop\nthe Sacramento Mountains.\n\nTemperatures will plummet across northwest New Mexico Monday\nafternoon and through the remainder of the state Monday night and\nearly Tuesday morning as the front plunges southeastward. High\ntemperatures on Tuesday will struggle to reach the freezing mark\nfor many locations. Very cold temperatures will persist through\nWednesday as well.\n\nAnyone planning travel in New Mexico Monday and Tuesday should be\nprepared to encounter adverse weather conditions. Monitor NOAA\nweather radio, weather.gov/abq or your local media for the latest\nweather updates. For the latest New Mexico road conditions visit\nnmroads.com or call 5-1-1.",
