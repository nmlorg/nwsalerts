For the Small Craft Advisory,\nnortheast winds 10 to 20 knots with gusts up to 25 knots and\nwaves 1 to 4 feet expected.\n\n* WHERE...Grand Portage to Grand Marais MN.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 6 PM this\nevening to 9 AM CST Sunday. For the Small Craft Advisory, from\n4 PM this afternoon to 4 PM CST Sunday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nAnyone operating a smaller vessel should avoid navigating in\nhazardous conditions.",
