Large breaking waves can cause injury, wash\npeople off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near\nshore.",

Rock jetties can be deadly in\nsuch conditions, stay off the rocks.\n\nIf caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don't swim against\nthe current. If able, swim in a direction following the shoreline.\nIf unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave for help.",
