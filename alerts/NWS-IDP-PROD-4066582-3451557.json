West\nwinds 20 to 30 kt with gusts up to 40 kt and waves 7 to 10\nfeet expected.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of Eastern and Western Lake Superior.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, until 7 AM EST /6\nAM CST/ Thursday. For the Gale Warning, from 1 PM EST /noon\nCST/ Thursday to 4 AM EST /3 AM CST/ Friday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
