        "description": "...Series of Canadian Winter Storms Will Bring Moderate to Heavy\nSnow to the Mountains and Highlands of eastern Idaho...\n\n.A series of winter storms moving in from Canada and across\ncentral and eastern Idaho will bring consistent snowfall to the\nregion starting Wednesday morning and continuing through Friday\nafternoon. Snow and rain will mix at low elevations at times,\nreducing the total snowfall for the populated cities. However,\nfor the eastern highlands from the Montana border southward to\nthe Utah border expect all snow, with heavy snow (10 to 20 inches\nover two and a half days) in the big Hole Mountains and the\nCentennial Mountains and Island Park area. Elsewhere in the Idaho-\nWyoming border region, moderate snow (6 to 12 inches over two and\na half days) is expected in the Teton Valley, the Caribou\nhighlands, Blackfoot Mountains, and the Bear River Mountains.\nSnowfall rates will be consistent once snow gets started on\nWednesday morning. Starting Thursday afternoon, the snowfall will\nbe combined with moderate to strong wind to cause reduced\nvisibility in blowing snow and travel problems with heavy\ndrifting of snow.\n\nAlso on Thursday, moderate snow will intensify in the Sawtooth\nMountains and Stanley basin to cause similar issues for those\nliving and traveling to the area.\n\nSnowfall should start to decrease Friday afternoon.\n\n* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 12\ninches over a two and a half day period, except 10 to 20\ninches on ridge tops and elevations above passes. Winds\ngusting as high as 45 mph on Thursday and Friday.\n\n* WHERE...The Teton Valley, including the cities of Ashton,\nTetonia, and Driggs, the Blackfoot and Caribou Mountain areas,\nincluding Wayan, Soda Springs, and Chesterfield Reservoir, and\nfinally the Bear River Mountains.\n\n* WHEN...From 11 AM Wednesday to 5 PM MST Friday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Gusty\nwinds could bring down tree branches.",
