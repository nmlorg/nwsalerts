While additional snowfall amounts will be\nlight except in the eastern highlands along the Wyoming border\nand central Idaho mountains, wind will once again cause a drifting\nproblem for snow removal efforts and low visibility for drivers.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations of 4 to 9\ninches. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.\n\n* WHERE...The eastern highlands of Idaho along the Wyoming border,\nfrom Macks Inn at the Montana border to the Bear River Range of\nMountains at the Utah border.\n\n* WHEN...Until 5 PM MST Tuesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel will be difficult at times, especially\noutside of well-maintained travel corridors. Blowing snow\ncould significantly reduce visibility and possibly cause road\nclosures.",
