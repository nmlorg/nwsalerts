        "description": "...Heavy rain will bring a good chance of flooding...\n\n.A powerful low pressure system will move slowly into the\nCarolinas from the west through Thursday night. Bands of heavy\nshowers passing repeatedly over the same areas will bring a risk\nfor flooding Thursday into Thursday night, especially over the\nPiedmont.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Raleigh has issued a\n\n* Flood Watch for a portion of central North Carolina, including\nthe following areas, Alamance, Anson, Chatham, Davidson,\nDurham, Forsyth, Franklin, Granville, Guilford, Lee,\nMontgomery, Moore, Orange, Person, Randolph, Richmond, Stanly,\nVance, Wake, and Warren.\n\n* From Thursday morning through late Thursday night.\n\n* A powerful storm system will bring periods of heavy rain\nThursday into Thursday night, especially over the Piedmont.\nStorm total rainfall of 2 to 5 inches is expected in this area,\nwith the highest totals likely to be in the Triad region.\n\n* Rapid rises on creeks are likely, along with flooding in low\nlying and poor drainage areas. Flooding is also expected on some\nmain stem rivers in the Piedmont. Wet pavement and considerable\nponding of water on roads will raise the risk of hydroplaning.",
