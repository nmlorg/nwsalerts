        "description": "A round of snow followed by windy and much colder weather is\nanticipated during the next 36 hours as an arctic cold front\nsurges south across the area. Snow will accompany the front,\nfollowed by a short-lived but fairly intense shot of cold air.\n\nSnow associated with the front will overspread north-central and\nfar northeast Wisconsin through early to mid afternoon, then\nreach central and east-central Wisconsin during the late afternoon\nand early evening hours. Milder air will flow into the area ahead\nof the front, possibly warming temperatures enough to cause some\nrain to briefly mix with the snow at the onset over central and\neast-central Wisconsin. The snow over north-central Wisconsin\nwill taper off during the evening, though snow showers off Lake\nSuperior will continue to affect the snowbelt. The steadier snow\nwill continue over east-central Wisconsin until at least midnight\nbefore diminishing overnight. A widespread 1 to 3 inch snowfall\nis anticipated across the area.\n\nNorth winds will increase and become gusty as the colder air pours\ninto the area tonight. This will cause some blowing and drifting\nof the snow, especially in east-central Wisconsin. Temperatures\nwill also fall sharply. By daybreak Thursday, the combination of\nwind and cold temperatures will result in wind chills ranging\nfrom around 20 below zero in north-central Wisconsin to around 5\nbelow along the lakeshore. Wind chills around 20 below zero\ncan cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nAdditional snow accumulations after midnight will be minor and\nprobably limited to the Lake Superior snowbelt and areas near\nLake Michigan. However, the cold temperatures and blowing and\ndrifting snow will probably hinder the efforts of highway crews\nto treat the roads, and result in hazardous travel conditions\nlingering through the Thursday morning commute.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving this afternoon\nthrough tomorrow morning, as roads will be snow covered and\nslippery in spots. Also plan on needing to wear warm winter\nclothing Thursday due to the combination of wind and cold.",
