        "description": "Above normal temperatures seen today will be displaced by much\ncolder air behind a cold front moving through the area this\nevening, through the overnight hours. Precipitation will break out\nover the Pecos River valley into the mountains of west Texas\nbefore moving quickly to the north and east during the morning.\nTemperatures across northern Lea and the northwest Permian Basin\nwill be near to just below freezing, leading to the first\npotential of wintry precipitation in the form of freezing rain\nMonday morning.\n\nA break in the precipitation is expected for Monday afternoon and\nfirst half of the overnight into Tuesday, but more precipitation\nis expected towards the morning across the region. A second cold\nfront will press south quickly, leading to temperatures dropping\nbelow freezing over northern Lea county, the Guadalupe Mountains\nand the northern Permian Basin during the morning hours.\nPrecipitation over areas that are near and below freezing will\nbegin as freezing rain before transitioning to snow and/or sleet\nduring the afternoon time frame. Snow chances will develop further\nsouth Tuesday night into Wednesday morning as cold air filters\ntoward the I-20 corridor. All precipitation will end west to east\nWednesday morning. Light snow and ice accumulations are expected\nover the Guadalupe Mountains and the northern portions of the\nforecast area Tuesday and Wednesday with slick road conditions\nlikely in areas that see ice and snow.\n\nBe sure to monitor NOAA weather radio and visit our website at\nweather.gov/maf for the latest weather updates.",
