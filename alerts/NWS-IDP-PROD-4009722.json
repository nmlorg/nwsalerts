        "description": "Periods of snow showers, mixed with some rain at the lowest\nelevations, will continue to move across much of the Greater\nPortland and Vancouver metro areas through late this morning. in\nareas where snow showers are heaviest and most persistent, light\nsnow accumulations are possible on any elevated or exposed road\nsurfaces. Slow down and use extra caution on bridges, ramps,\noverpasses and other elevated road surfaces this morning that\ncould be locally slick and hazardous.\n\nFarther south in the Willamette Valley, local areas of clearing\nhave allowed temperatures to drop to slightly below freezing,\nwhich has resulted in slick spots on elevated road surfaces such\nand bridges, ramps and overpasses. Temperatures should rise to\nabove freezing in most areas by around 10 AM.\n\nAllow plenty of extra travel time this morning, and slow down, and\nallow for extra following distance between vehicles as roads may\nbe icy; especially on secondary roads and overpasses in outlying\nareas. For current road conditions in Oregon, check tripcheck.com,\nand wsdot.com for Washington road conditions.",
