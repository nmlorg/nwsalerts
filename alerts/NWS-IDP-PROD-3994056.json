Near complete ice cover should be expected within\nthe next couple days for the Missouri River between Morton and\nBurleigh counties. Higher water levels are expected up north of\nthe Bismarck Mandan area. Even though problematic high water is\nrare this time of year, it cannot be ruled out as ice forms and\nshifts. Due to the length of colder weather expected, ice\nformation and higher water on the Missouri River between Oliver\nand McLean counties is likely as well.",
