Some\npockets of dense fog were also noted, with visibilities at Fort\nMadison, Keokuk and Washington reduced to less that a quarter of\na mile. This fog will continue to slowly work east, and will\nimpact much of west central Illinois through mid-morning.\n\nVisibilities will be less than a mile with the potential for 1/4\nmile or less in spots.\n\nMotorists should drive with extra caution and allow additional\ntravel time. Use low beams, reduce speed, and allow for plenty of\nroom between you and other cars.",
