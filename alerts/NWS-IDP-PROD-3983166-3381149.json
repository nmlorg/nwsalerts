For the\nGale Watch, from Thursday afternoon through Friday afternoon.\n\n* IMPACTS...Strong winds will cause hazardous seas which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "A Gale Warning means winds of 34 to 47 knots are imminent or\noccurring. Operating a vessel in gale conditions requires\nexperience and properly equipped vessels. It is highly\nrecommended that mariners without the proper experience seek safe\nharbor prior to the onset of gale conditions.\n\nA Gale Watch is issued when the risk of gale force winds of 34 to\n47 knots has significantly increased, but the specific timing\nand/or location is still uncertain. It is intended to provide\nadditional lead time for mariners who may wish to consider\naltering their plans.",
