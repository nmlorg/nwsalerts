        "description": "Light, powdery snow could limit visibilities along roadways today.\nA band of snow will drift from Cook Inlet over the Anchorage Bowl\nthis morning. Generally around 1-3\" of snow is expected. Due to\nthe cold temperatures, the snow is expected to be a powdery\nconsistency. Powdery snow is very prone to becoming resuspended by\nfast-moving vehicle traffic. This will locally reduce visibility,\nespecially along the Glenn and Seward Highways through this\nevening. Conditions will improve overnight tonight as snow tapers\noff. Drivers are urged to leave plenty of extra space between\nvehicles and to use caution.",
