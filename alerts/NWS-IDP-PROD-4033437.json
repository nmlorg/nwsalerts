        "description": "Areas of freezing drizzle over southwest Wisconsin will move\ninto Sauk, Columbia, Marquette, and Green Lake Counties into the\nearly morning hours. Thus areas of black ice may form on untreated\nroads. Over eastern and far southern Wisconsin, snow\naccumulations under one half inch are expected into the early\nmorning hours, with the potential for patchy freezing drizzle\nafterward.\n\nBlack ice can be especially dangerous because you may not be able\nto see it until you have already encountered it. If traveling,\nuse extreme caution, especially on bridges, overpasses, and\nelevated highways where water freezes first. Do not assume that a\nwell traveled road will be free of ice.",
