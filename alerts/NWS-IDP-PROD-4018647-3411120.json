The White River is cresting at Petersburg and Hazleton.\nThe crest on the East Fork White is now downstream of Shoals.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers\nwill continue until the last few days of the month.\n\nOur next precipitation event is forecast to come Friday, thus we\nwill have 5 plus days of dry weather allowing drainage of area\nwaterways.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River at Hazleton.\n* until further notice.\n* There have been no observations in the last 24 hours.\n* Flood stage is 16.0 feet.\n* Moderate flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It is forecast to crest at 25.3 feet this afternoon.\n* At 25.0 feet...Extensive river flooding continues in northern Gibson\nCounty.
