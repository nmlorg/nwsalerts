The river will rise again Friday and go\nabove flood stage Friday night.\n* Impact...At 16.5 feet, the Skokomish River will cause widespread\nflooding of pasture lands, with water flowing quickly over West\nBourgault Road and Skokomish Valley Road. The evacuation route will\nbe opened to the west end of the Skokomish Valley Road.",
