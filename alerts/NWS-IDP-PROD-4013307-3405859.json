In Missouri, Barry, Barton, Benton,\nCamden, Cedar, Christian, Dade, Dallas, Dent, Douglas, Greene,\nHickory, Howell, Jasper, Laclede, Lawrence, Maries, McDonald,\nMiller, Morgan, Newton, Oregon, Ozark, Phelps, Polk, Pulaski,\nShannon, St. Clair, Stone, Taney, Texas, Vernon, Webster, and\nWright.\n\n* From Friday morning through late Friday night\n\n* Widespread rainfall is expected to range from roughly an inch to\nan inch and three quarters. Soil conditions along with the lack\nof vegetation in the winter time will also contribute to\nflooding of small streams, creeks, and rivers.\n\n* Flooding of low water crossings and low lying roadways near\nstreams, creeks, and rivers is expected to occur.",
