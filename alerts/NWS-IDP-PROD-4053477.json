This rain coupled with the already saturated\nground has caused small streams and creeks to rise.  Some minor\nflooding of low lying and poor drainage areas have been noted.\n\nPlease allow extra time for travel and Do not drive your vehicle\nthrough flooded roadways.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nSummersville, Richwood, Webster Springs, Addison (Webster Springs),\nCamden-On-gauley, Birch River, Craigsville, Camden On Gauley, Holly\nRiver State, Cowen, Muddlety, Upper Glade, Swiss, Waneta, Boggs,\nHacker Valley, Drennan, Bergoo, Mount Nebo and Erbacon.\n\nThis includes Route 19 between mile markers 31 and 61.\n\nIn hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are\npotentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to travel across\nflooded roads. Find alternate routes. It takes only a few inches of\nswiftly flowing water to carry vehicles away.",
