This band is\nquick moving but is capable of brief moderate snow that will\nreduce visibility to between 2 and 3 miles and put down a light\naccumulation of snow. The band of snow looks as though it will\njust graze the Des Moines metro area but areas just north of Des\nMoines will see some light accumulation. Additional light snow is\nexpected later tonight.",
