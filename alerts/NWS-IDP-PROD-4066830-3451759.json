For the Freezing Spray Advisory, from 1 AM\nto 1 PM EST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in freezing spray is hazardous.\nFreezing spray may render mechanical and electronic components\ninoperative. Ice accretion on decks and superstructures may\nresult in some loss of stability. Strong winds will cause\nhazardous seas which could capsize or damage vessels and\nreduce visibility.",
