        "description": "An Arctic cold front will push across Upper Michigan Wednesday\nafternoon and evening bringing a burst of moderate lake effect\nsnow and extensive blowing snow from strong northerly winds\ngusting between 30 and 35 mph at times. North to northwest wind\nlake effect snow will become lighter late Wednesday night into\nThursday night as much colder and drier air pushing in from north\nof Lake Superior results in finer snowflakes. The finer\nsnowflakes, however, will be more effective at reducing visibility\nin blowing snow late Wednesday night into Thursday.\n\nMuch colder air moving in behind the front will also cause\ntemperatures to quickly plummet from northwest to southeast across\nUpper Michigan Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday evening.\nTemperatures dropping into the single digits combined with the\ngusty north winds will cause wind chill values to dip as low as\n20 below zero late Wednesday night into Thursday morning. As winds\ndiminish and back more westerly late Thursday night, clearing\nskies will allow actual temperatures to drop into the double\ndigits below zero over interior portions of west and central Upper\nMichigan by early Friday morning, perhaps as low as 20 below zero\nat a few locations.\n\nThose planning travel or outside recreation over Upper Michigan\nWednesday into early Friday will need to plan accordingly for a\nsharp change to hazardous winter weather conditions. Please stay\ntuned to the National Weather Service for the latest updated\nstatements and forecasts on this developing winter weather event.",
