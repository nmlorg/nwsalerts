For the High Rip Current Risk, dangerous\nrip currents.\n\n* WHERE...Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie, Martin, and Coastal\nVolusia counties.\n\n* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 10 PM EST this\nevening. For the High Rip Current Risk, until 7 PM EST this\nevening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and\nlocalized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best\nswimmers away from shore into deeper water.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The next high tide along the Florida\nAtlantic coast will occur between 630 and 700 PM this evening.\nThe threat for rip currents will be present all day, but will\nbe highest between 1000 AM and 400 PM due to tidal effects.",
        "instruction": "High surf will affect the beaches in the advisory area, producing\nlocalized beach erosion and dangerous swimming conditions.\nSwimmers should remain out of the water due to large breaking\nwaves and dangerous surf conditions.\n\nRip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away\nfrom shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the\nsandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and\npiers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.",
