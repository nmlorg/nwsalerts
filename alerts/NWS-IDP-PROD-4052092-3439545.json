        "description": "...HEAVY RAINFALL AND POTENTIAL FLASH FLOODING THIS AFTERNOON\nTHROUGH TUESDAY...\n\n.A slow-moving frontal boundary will continue to bring moderate\nto heavy rainfall to the southwest North Carolina mountains, parts\nof northeast Georgia, and far western Upstate South Carolina\nthrough tonight and into Tuesday. With the ground saturated from\nheavy rainfall last week, and many streams running at elevated\nflow, additional flash flooding is expected to redevelop within\nthe watch area beginning tonight and continuing into Tuesday. In\naddition, some main stem river flooding is likely to develop\nwithin and close to the watch area.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued\na\n\n* Flash Flood Watch for portions of northeast Georgia, western\nNorth Carolina, and upstate South Carolina, including the\nfollowing areas, in northeast Georgia, Franklin, Habersham,\nRabun, and Stephens. In western North Carolina, Graham,\nHaywood, Macon, Northern Jackson, Southern Jackson, Swain, and\nTransylvania. In upstate South Carolina, Anderson, Greater\nGreenville, Greater Oconee, Greater Pickens, Greenville\nMountains, Oconee Mountains, and Pickens Mountains.\n\n* through Tuesday evening\n\n* Rainfall amounts through Tuesday are expected to range from 2 to\n4 inches across the Piedmont, with 3 to 6 inches expected across\nthe mountains. Locally higher amounts can be expected. In light\nof the saturated ground and elevated stream flows resulting from\nlast week's heavy rainfall, this rainfall will likely result in\ndevelopment of localized flash flooding, some of which could be\nsignificant.\n\n* Rapid rises above bankfull on streams and creeks may occur,\nalong with the threat of flooded roadways. Flooding is also\nlikely to re-develop on main stem rivers in and close to the\nwatch area. Numerous landslides were reported in southwest North\nCarolina last week, and the additional heavy rainfall will\ngreatly increase the risk of additional landslides the Smoky\nMountains, Nantahala Mountains, Unicoi Mountains, and other high\nterrain areas of southwest North Carolina, northeast Georgia,\nand South Carolina.",
