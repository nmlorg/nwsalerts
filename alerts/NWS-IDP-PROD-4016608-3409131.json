        "description": "...Winter Storm Moving Into The Area...Will Last Through\nSaturday...\n\n.Widespread accumulating snow and a wintry mix of snow, sleet and\nfreezing rain at times, will continue to spread northeastward\nacross the area this afternoon and last through Saturday morning.\nSnow accumulations of 2 to 5 inches are likely, along with ice\naccumulations of up to two tenths of an inch. Locally higher\namounts of snow may occur in areas that remain in snow for longer\ndurations and at higher snowfall rates. There also may be a period\nof sleet accumulation. Strong southeast winds gusting up to 30 to\n35 MPH this afternoon and evening when combined with the falling\nprecipitation will further reduce visibilities and cause dangerous\ntraveling conditions.\n\nBy Saturday morning, very strong northwest winds gusting to 40 to\n45 MPH will lead to blowing and drifting snow with greatly\nreduced visibility. These winds will combine with falling\ntemperatures to produce wind chills down to 10 below zero to\n20 below zero during the evening hours Saturday.\n\n* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations\nof 3 to 5 inches and ice accumulations of up to one tenth of\nan inch. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of north central and northwest Illinois.\n\n* WHEN...From noon Friday to 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing\nsnow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous\nconditions will impact the evening commute.",
