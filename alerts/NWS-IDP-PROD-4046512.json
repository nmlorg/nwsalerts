        "description": "Although the rainfall amounts further north across the Quad State\nregion are trending lower with the latest forecasts, the southern\nborder counties of west Kentucky still remain in a zone where one\nto one and a half inches of rain may occur late Wednesday night\ninto Thursday morning.\n\nGiven the timing and intensity of the rainfall, this may have the\npotential for producing isolated flooding of low lying or poorly\ndrained locations.\n\nThere continues to remain significant uncertainty as to the\nevolution of weather system expected to develop and move out of\nCalifornia this weekend. The location, intensity, and movement of\nthis system will have a direct impact on rainfall amounts over\nsouthern sections of west Kentucky Wednesday night and early\nThursday, especially along and south of a Mayfield to Greenville\nKentucky line.\n\nIndividuals and organizations in southern sections of west\nKentucky should continue to monitor forecasts through early next\nweek for any further assessment of heavy rain potential.",
