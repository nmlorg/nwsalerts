        "description": "Strengthening tropical activity in the region will generate an\nextended period of strong and gusty winds, heavy rainfall, increased\ndangerous surf and coastal hazards this weekend across American\nSamoa. Trends suggest that these hazardous weather conditions will\nlikely continue into next week.\n\nThe strong winds will have the potential to blow down trees, down\npower lines, blow around loose objects, damage roofs and small\nout-buildings and outdoor kitchen. Additionally, travel becomes\nmore difficult during high wind events, especially for high profile\nvehicles.\n\nFrequent periods of heavy rainfall will increase the risk for\nflash flooding, flooded roadways, overflowing streams, and landslides\ninto early next week.\n\nWe expect hazardous seas which will create high surf conditions\nalong with gale force winds along American Samoa coastal waters.\nThese conditions will be hazardous to small crafts, due to strong\nrip currents which may capsize or damage vessels.\n\nAmerican Samoa is in the middle of hurricane season. It is important\nto actively listen for the latest updates from your National Weather\nService and TEMCO. You may also contact EOC at 699-3800 for more\nprecautionary and preparedness actions.
