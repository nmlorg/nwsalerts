        "description": "...Winter Storm Continues into Saturday...\n\n.Snow has transitioned to a wintry mix of freezing rain and sleet\nacross much of eastern Iowa and west central Illinois. This\ntransition will continue to move across northwest Illinois the\nrest of the evening. Overnight, the freezing rain and sleet may\ntaper off to freezing drizzle. Total snow and sleet accumulations\nof 2 to 6 inches are likely, along with ice accumulations up to\ntwo tenths of an inch. Strong southeast winds gusting up to 30 to\n35 MPH through this evening when combined with the falling\nprecipitation will further reduce visibilities and cause\ndangerous traveling conditions. By Saturday morning, very strong\nnorthwest winds gusting to 40 to 45 MPH will lead to blowing and\ndrifting snow with greatly reduced visibility. These winds will\ncombine with falling temperatures to produce wind chills down to\n10 below zero to 20 below zero during the evening hours Saturday.\n\n* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Additional snow and sleet\naccumulation of an inch or less. Total snow and sleet\naccumulations of 3 to 6 inches and ice accumulations of a tenth\nto two tenths possible. Northwest winds gusting around 40 mph on\nSaturday.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of east central, northeast and southeast Iowa\nand northwest Illinois.\n\n* WHEN...From noon Friday to 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Difficult travel due to snow covered or icy roads.\nPatchy blowing snow could reduce visibilities on Saturday.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...For areas that received ice accumulation,\nthe heavy weight of the ice combined with strong winds on\nSaturday could bring down tree branches and lead to isolated\npower outages.",
        "instruction": "If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in\nyour vehicle in case of an emergency.\n\nIn Illinois, go to www.gettingaroundillinois.com for road\nconditions. In Iowa, call 511 for road conditions.",
