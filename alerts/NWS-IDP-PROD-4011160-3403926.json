        "description": "...Icy and Very Hazardous Morning Commute...\n\n.A quick moving system will bring widespread freezing drizzle to\nthe area through much of the morning. With temperatures only in\nthe 20s, roads and sidewalks will instantly become ice covered.\nUntreated roads and sidewalks, along with bridges and overpasses\nwill be especially vulnerable to icing. Plan now for travel\nimpacts during the morning commute. As temperatures gradually rise\nabove freezing later this morning the freezing drizzle may change\nto plain drizzle from south to north.\n\n* WHAT...Freezing drizzle and very light freezing rain expected.\nTotal ice accumulations of a light glaze to less than a tenth\nof an inch.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of east central, northeast and southeast Iowa\nand north central and northwest Illinois.\n\n* WHEN...Through noon today.\n\n* IMPACTS...Very slippery sidewalks, roads and bridges are\nexpected. The hazardous conditions will impact the morning\ncommute.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Eventually temperatures will rise above\nfreezing from south to north by late morning ending the threat\nfor freezing drizzle. Until this occurs, slick roads and other\nsurfaces are expected.",
