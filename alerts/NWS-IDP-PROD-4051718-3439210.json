Although showers are moving quickly toward the\nsoutheast, ponding of water is occurring in central, northern and\nleeward Oahu due to the brief but torrential showers.\n\n* Locations in the advisory include but are not limited to...\nMililani, Wahiawa, Waialua, Schofield Barracks, Kaneohe Marine\nBase, Kahaluu, Ahuimanu, Kaneohe, Waianae, Wheeler Field, Kunia and\nKapolei.",
        "instruction": "Stay away from streams, drainage ditches and low lying areas prone to\nflooding.\n\nRainfall and runoff will also cause hazardous driving conditions due\nto ponding, reduced visibility and poor braking action.\n\nDo not cross fast flowing or rising water in your vehicle, or on\nfoot. Turn around, don't drown.",
