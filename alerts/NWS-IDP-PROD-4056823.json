        "description": "The arctic cold front has pushed south of the area. Light snow\nwill taper off to scattered flurries by late evening. Any\nadditional snowfall accumulation should be less than an inch.\nThe combination of the falling snow, along with melting snow on\npavement surfaces and falling air temperatures well below freezing\ncould lead to a flash freeze this evening. Gusty northerly winds\nmay also create some areas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nOvernight, temperatures are expected to fall to 5 below to 5 above\nzero. The combination of the cold temperatures and gusty northerly\nwinds will produce wind chill readings in the 10 below to 20\nbelow zero range late tonight into Thursday morning. Wind chill\nreadings this low can produce frost bite in 30 minutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving this evening as\nroads will be slippery due to ice or snow. If venturing outdoors\novernight, wear layers of clothing along with a hat and gloves to\nprotect yourself from the cold.",
