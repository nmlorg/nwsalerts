Some patches of black\nice can be expected in locations where the temperature is below\nfreezing and where roads failed to dry off because of runoff or\nsnow melt from yesterdays precipitation. Patchy dense fog was also\nbeing observed, mainly in the mountain valleys. Some pockets of\nfreezing fog were also occurring where the temperature was below\nfreezing. All of this will combine to cause some potentially\nhazardous road conditions through daybreak, mainly over the\nmountains and foothills.",
