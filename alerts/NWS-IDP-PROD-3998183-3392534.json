Strong rip currents and sneaker waves.\n\n* WHERE...West to northwest facing beaches of the San Luis\nObispo County and Santa Barbara County Central Coast.\n\n* WHEN...From 6 PM Saturday to 6 AM PST Monday.\n\n* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip\ncurrents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large\nbreaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and\nrocks, and capsize small boats near shore.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An above normal high tide of 6.5 feet late\nSunday morning will result in the possibility of localized minor\ncoastal flooding at that time over low-lying coastal areas such\nas beach parking lots and harbor walkways. No significant\ndamage is expected.",
