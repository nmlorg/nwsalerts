Total snow accumulations of 1 to 2 inches\nwith isolated amounts near 3 inches possible. Brief moderate to\nheavy bands of snow may drop visibilities down to a quarter\nmile at times.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of east central and northeast Iowa.\n\n* WHEN...Until 3 AM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions and rapid changes in\nvisibility.
