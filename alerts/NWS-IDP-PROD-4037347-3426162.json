        "instruction": "A Winter Weather Advisory is issued for a variety of winter\nweather conditions, such as snow, blowing snow, sleet, or\nfreezing drizzle and rain. It only takes a small amount of wintry\nprecipitation to make roads, bridges, sidewalks, and parking lots\nicy and dangerous. It is often difficult to tell when ice begins\nto form, so do not be caught off guard.\n\nA Winter Storm Watch is advanced notice that the potential for\nsevere winter weather exists in the Watch area, but it does not\nmean it is a certainty. Those in the Watch area should begin\npreparing in case the storm does materialize. If you have travel\nplanned, you may want to adjust your travel time to avoid the\nstorm. Also, you should use this advanced notice to make certain\nyour vehicle is winterized. Make preparations at home by stocking\nemergency supplies, such as food, medicine, and extra heating\nfuel, just in case the storm makes travel impossible. This is\nespecially important for those living in rural areas.\n\nIn Illinois, the latest road conditions can be obtained on the\nInternet at www.gettingaroundillinois.com. In Missouri, the\nlatest road conditions can be obtained on the Internet at\ntraveler.modot.org/map/ or by calling 1-888-275-6636.",
