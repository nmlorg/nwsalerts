        "description": "...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS EXPECTED IN WESTERN MINNESOTA WEDNESDAY...\n...DANGEROUS WIND CHILLS EXPECTED WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH\nTHURSDAY MORNING...\n\n.A Blizzard Warning remains in effect for portions of west\ncentral and southwest Minnesota starting 6 am Wednesday morning,\nand continues through the afternoon. A Winter Storm Watch with\nblizzard conditions possible surround the blizzard warning in west\ncentral, southwest and south central Minnesota for the same time\nperiod. Wind Chill Warnings have been issued for west central\nthrough southwestern Minnesota, with Wind Chill Advisories issued\nfor east central Minnesota, portions of southeast Minnesota and\nfar western Wisconsin for Wednesday night into Thursday morning.\n\nConfidence has increased that portions of west central and\nsouthwest Minnesota, mainly west of a Morris to Redwood Falls to\nSt. James line, will have blizzard conditions developing behind a\nstrong Arctic front on Wednesday. The combination of strong gusty\nwinds and whiteout conditions will lead to blizzard conditions\nfor several hours. Confidence is lower on wind speeds farther to\nthe east and thus a Winter Storm Watch has been issued.\n\nOutside the warning and watch area, significant blowing and\ndrifting snow is likely, with locally one to two inches of snow by\nthe afternoon.\n\nIn addition to the blizzard conditions, temperatures will drop\noff sharply behind the Arctic front. Wind chill values will drop\n30 degrees below zero by the afternoon in west central Minnesota,\nwith wind chills likely dropping to 35 degrees below zero by the\nevening, persisting through Thursday morning. In eastern\nMinnesota into western Wisconsin, wind chills will drop to between\n25 and 35 degrees below zero late Wednesday night through\nThursday morning. Outside the warning and watch area, significant\nblowing and drifting snow is likely, with locally one to two\ninches of snow by the afternoon.\n\n* WHAT...Very cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as low as\n35 below zero.\n\n* WHERE...Morrison, Mille Lacs, Benton and Wright Counties.\n\n* WHEN...From 10 PM Wednesday to 10 AM CST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...The dangerously cold wind chills could cause\nfrostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.",
