In\naddition, sub-freezing surface temperatures may combine with fog\nto cause slick spots, especially on bridges and overpasses.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Visibility will vary somewhat tonight, and\ndense fog will probably not occur the entire time the Advisory\nis in effect. As drier air moves in from the west, dense fog\nwill likely improve first in Nebraska counties north of Highway\n6, and perhaps linger the longest in southern counties such as\nThayer, Jewell and Mitchell.",
