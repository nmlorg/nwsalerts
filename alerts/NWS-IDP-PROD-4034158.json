        "description": "* On Sunday a sharp cold front will rapidly push through the\nregion, bringing strong winds and a quick burst of snow.\nWidespread southwest winds Sunday morning will shift to the\nnorthwest behind the front. This will bring travel impacts on\nroadways and rough air for aviation. The strongest winds are\nanticipated to be near and south of US-50, with US-395 and US-95\npossibly seeing travel restrictions for high profile vehicles.\nAreas of blowing dust are also possible near and east of US-95.\nA very dry air mass will be in place ahead of the cold front,\nwhich along with the strong winds will bring increased fire\ndanger for Mono and Mineral Counties.\n\n* A brief period of higher intensity snow is also likely during\nthe day Sunday, which may cause travel impacts on roadways\nincluding across Sierra passes. Road impacts in Western Nevada\ncities remain more uncertain due to warm ground temperatures.\nHowever, don't be surprised if there are slick roads coming home\nfrom Sunday afternoon gatherings. Icy spots on roadways could\nlinger into Monday morning.\n\n* Monday and Tuesday will be cold, certainly compared to what\nwe've seen recently. Temperatures Monday will be about 30\ndegrees colder compared to Saturday. Brisk north winds will\nbring wind chills in the teens and 20s in warmer valley\nlocations with well below zero reading in the higher elevations\nof the Sierra. Snow showers are possible in this cold airmass,\nincluding lake effect snow squalls south of Pyramid, Tahoe, and\nWalker Lakes. This could affect travel on I-80 between Reno and\nFernley during the Monday morning commute.",
