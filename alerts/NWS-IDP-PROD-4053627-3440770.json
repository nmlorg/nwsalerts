The\nmost likely area to see heavy rain is west Kentucky and\nsouthwest Indiana. However, most areas can expect 1 to 2 inches\nof rain.\n\n* The ground is saturated so almost all of the rain will quickly\nrun off into streams and rivers. Water will continue to collect\nin low lying areas and will likely spread into areas that are\nnot normally prone to flooding. Low water crossings should be\navoided during this time.",
