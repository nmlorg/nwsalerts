        "description": "* Unusually pronounced high pressure will build into the region\nthrough Saturday, bringing above normal temperatures and mostly\nsunny skies. Temperatures Saturday could approach record highs.\nNo doubt a great time for outdoor recreation or even yard work\nyou've been putting off.\n\n* On Sunday a strong cold front will push quickly through the\nregion, yielding strong winds and snow. Widespread strong\nsouthwest winds Sunday morning will turn to the northwest behind\nthe front Sunday afternoon/evening. This will result in impacts\nfor high profile vehicles and rough air for aviation. Highways\n395 and 95, especially south of I-80, are at particular risk of\nwind impacts. This includes Walker Lake and Mono County.\n\n* A brief period of higher intensity snow is also likely during\nthe day Sunday, which could cause travel impacts on roadways\nincluding across Sierra passes. Road impacts in Western Nevada\ncities are more uncertain due to warm ground temperatures.\nHowever, don't be surprised if there are slick roads coming home\nfrom Sunday afternoon gatherings. Icy spots on roadways could\nlinger into Monday morning.\n\n* Monday into Tuesday will feature cold temperatures, certainly\ncompared to what we've seen recently. Temperatures Monday will\nbe some 30 degrees colder versus highs on Saturday. Brisk north\nwinds will remind us all that it is still winter. Snow showers\nare possible in this cold airmass, including lake effect snow\nsqualls south of Pyramid, Tahoe, and Walker Lakes. This could\naffect travel on I-80 between Reno and Fernley during the Monday\nmorning commute.",
