        "description": "Light snow will affect most of southern Wisconsin overnight.\nAccumulations of mostly 1 to 3 inches are expected. A period of\nlight freezing rain or drizzle is also possible.\n\nHighest snow amounts will be along and north of a line from Lone\nRock to Juneau to Port Washington. Areas from Sheboygan west to\nFond du Lac, Berlin and Westfield may receive around 3 inches.\n\nThe snow and wintry mix will likely reduce visibilities and make\nroadways snow covered and slippery, thus potentially causing\nhazardous driving conditions for the early Monday morning commute.",
