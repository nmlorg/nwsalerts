Advisory for Monday night into Tuesday morning\nremains unchanged.\n\n* WHAT...For the Winter Weather Advisory, snow expected. Total\nsnow accumulations of 2 to 5 inches, with 5 to 10 inches above\n7000 feet near and west of Highway 89. Winds gusting as high as\n60 mph, with gusts over 100 mph on ridges. For the Winter Storm\nWatch, heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 8 to 18\ninches, except 12 to 24 inches above 7000 feet possible. Winds\ngusting as high as 55 mph, with gusts over 100 mph on ridges.\n\n* WHERE...Greater Lake Tahoe Area.\n\n* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, from 7 PM Monday to 10\nAM PST Tuesday. For the Winter Storm Watch, from late\nWednesday night through late Thursday night.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions and expect\nsignificant delays driving over Sierra passes. Chain controls\nare likely. The hazardous conditions will impact the Monday\nevening and Tuesday morning commutes. Travel could be\nvery difficult to impossible Wednesday night into Thursday with\nnear zero visibility and long delays possible.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong winds could cause tree damage and\nlow visibility situations for both storms. Waves on Lake Tahoe\nare projected to reach 4 to 6 feet Monday night into Tuesday\nmorning, especially near the east and northeast shores. Clearly\nthis would be dangerous for boating.",
        "instruction": "Monday-Tuesday: Even light snowfall causes major travel delays,\nespecially during periods of high traffic volume. Be sure to allow\nextra time to reach your destination. Leave extra space between\nvehicles since it takes longer to stop on slick roadways.\n\nWednesday Night-Thursday: Now is the time to prepare an emergency\nkit for your home and car. If traveling consider alternate plans,\nremember to carry tire chains, extra food, water and clothing.\nOnce the storm arrives, travel may be difficult or impossible for\nan extended period of time.\n\nThe latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.",
