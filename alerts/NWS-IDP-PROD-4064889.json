The\nsnow will change to a brief period of sleet and freezing rain\nTuesday afternoon before eventually transitioning to all rain.\n\nWhile any amounts of snow and ice will be rather minor, untreated\nroads might become slippery at elevations at or above 1000 feet.\nThe main areas of concern is along the east slopes of the\nBerkshires and northern Worcester Hills. Motorists planning travel\nlate Tuesday morning and afternoon should be prepared for\nslippery roadways and allow extra time to reach their destination.",
