        "description": "A cold front traveling south across Washington and Oregon will\nbring snow to the Blue Mountains this evening. Although overnight\nsnow accumulations are not expected to be significant, there will\nbe around six to eight hours of moderate snow, mainly from 6 PM\nto midnight. Accumulations of 3 to 5 inches over the Blue\nMountains north of Ukiah can be expected during this time.\nSnowfall rates of one half to one inch per hour will cause snow to\naccumulate fast on the roadways and significantly reduce\nvisibilities. If traveling over the Blue Mountains is not required\nthis evening, you may prefer to postpone travel until Sunday when\nsnow tapers off.\n\nThe Blue Mountains south of Ukiah, the Grande Ronde, Wallowa\nValley, the John Day Basin and surrounding mountains will have\nsnow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches tonight. Snow levels will\nlower to around 2500 feet in eastern Oregon overnight.",
