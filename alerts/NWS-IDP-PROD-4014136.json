Consider delaying travel until this squall passes\nyour location.\n\nIf you recognize an approching snow squall by terrain or trees\nbecoming obscured a mile or 2 ahead, slow down and put on your\nemergency flashers. Gradually reducing your speed, or exiting the\nroadway for a brief break until the squall passes, will greatly\nreduce the threat for serious multi-vehicle accidents.",
