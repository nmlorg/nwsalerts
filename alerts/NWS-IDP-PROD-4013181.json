A steady light to at\ntimes moderate-intensity snow is expected for the overnight into\nthe pre-dawn hours, which will reduce visibilities and result in a\nquick coating to two inches on roads through 4 AM. Snow amounts\nwill be greatest in the eastern slopes of the Berkshires and\nhills of northern Worcester County.\n\nDrivers early this morning should be prepared to encounter\nreduced visibilities and a greasy accumulation of snow on roads.\nDrive slowly if traveling overnight.",
