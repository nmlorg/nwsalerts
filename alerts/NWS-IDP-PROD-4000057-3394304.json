        "description": "* WHAT...Heavy freezing spray at a rate of 2 cm per hour or\ngreater expected, and may rapidly accumulate on vessels.\nNortheast winds 20 to 25 kt with gusts up to 35 kt and waves 6\nto 9 feet expected.\n\n* WHERE...Lake Superior from Upper Entrance to Portage Canal to\nManitou Island MI 5NM off shore to the US/Canadian Border.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, until 7 AM EST\nSunday. For the Gale Warning, from 7 PM this evening to 7 AM\nEST Sunday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
