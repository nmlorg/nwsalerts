Snow\naccumulation ranging from a dusting up to 1 inch for much of the\narea, but perhaps at least 2 to 3 inches in some counties\nsoutheast of the Nebraska Tri Cities. Ice accumulation ranging\nfrom none, up to perhaps a few hundredths of an inch. Winds will\naverage 10 to 25 MPH from the south.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of north central Kansas and central, east\ncentral and south central Nebraska.\n\n* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to noon CST Wednesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on the possibility of slippery road conditions in\nat least parts of the Advisory area, which could impact the\nWednesday morning commute.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Due to temperatures both at the surface and\naloft hovering close to the freezing mark, this is a relatively\nlow-confidence snow and ice forecast. A difference of only a\ndegree or two in expected temperatures could mean the difference\nbetween receiving snow or ice, or simply having a cold rain\nwith no travel issues. Because of this, please stay up to date\nwith the latest forecast and be open to possible changes.",
