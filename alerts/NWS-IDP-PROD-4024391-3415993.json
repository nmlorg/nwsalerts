Ida northward to Harrison and Mountain Home.\n\n* WHEN: From Wednesday morning through Wednesday night.\n\n* ACCUMULATIONS: Minor accumulation of snow and sleet of up to 1\ninch is expected in some areas...with locally higher amounts\nnearing 2 inches possible in the higher terrain. A trace to\njust over a tenth of an inch of ice is forecast as\nprecipitation transitions to freezing rain late Wednesday into\nThursday.... with locally higher amounts in the higher\nterrain.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS: Cold surface temperatures will allow the\nsnow/sleet and freezing rain to cause some slick spots on area\nroadways, especially elevated surfaces such as bridges and\noverpasses.
