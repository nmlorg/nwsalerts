        "description": "The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has extended\nthe\n\n* Flood Advisory for...\nEast central Greenville County in Upstate South Carolina...\n\n* Until 1130 PM EST Friday.\n\n* At 510 PM EST, Doppler radar indicates the earlier heavy rainfall\nhas ended across central Greenville County; however, an area of 1-3\ninches of rainfall occurred between approximately 10:30am and noon,\ncausing flooding of low-lying areas and several roadways. Excessive\nrunoff from this rainfall is still working through area streams.\nWhile most small streams have crested and receded, larger streams\nincluding the upper Reedy and Middle Tyger rivers are still out of\nbanks and are just now cresting.  Therefore, it will take several more\nhours for larger streams to crest and fully recede below critical\nlevels.  Therefore, the Flood Advisory will be extended until these\nlarger streams fall below Action/Advisory Stage.\n\n* Several reports of flooded roads were received by local media\nand law enforcement earlier this afternoon.  These roads included:\nSpartanburg St, Hilly St, the Swamp Rabbit Trail at River St,\nLakehurst St, Byrdland Dr, and West Blue Ridge Dr.  While most\nfloodwaters have receded along smaller streams, residual flooding\nof poorly draining areas may continue this evening and areas along\nthe Reedy River and Swamp Rabbit Trail will remain flooded as well.\nIt is important to continue to heed all barricades and seek an\nalternative route, especially at night.\n\n* The following streamgauges have approached Minor Flood Stage:\nReedy River at Hudson St and Reedy River at Westfield St.\n\nCurrent Stage: 9.8 feet and cresting.\nForecast: Reedy Creek will recede through this evening and fall\nbelow Action/Advisory Stage before midnight.\nAction Stage: 8.0 feet.\nMinor Flood Stage: 10.0 feet.\nImpacts: At 10.0 feet, Minor Flood Stage. Closure of portions\nof the Swamp Rabbit Trail continue, especially near the River St\nunderpass. Cleveland Park and Lakehurst St are closed due to\nbackwater flooding along Richland Creek.  Floodwaters are\napproaching Hudson St. Backwater effects along Long Branch may\nbe causing flooding of adjacent low-lying areas, including near\nLily St and Westside Park. Heavy rainfall over Brushy Creek in\nW Greenville has forced evacuation of a mobile home on Ross St.\n\n* The following streamgauge has exceeded Action/Advisory Stage:\nBrushy Creek at Dry Pocket Rd near Taylors.\n\nCurrent Stage: 7.61 feet and rising steadily.\nForecast: Brushy Creek will continue to rise to near 8 feet before\ncresting by 7pm.\nAction Stage: 7.5 feet.\nMinor Flood Stage: 13.5 feet.\nImpacts: At 8.0 feet, low-lying areas along Brushy Creek from\nDevenger Rd to Thornblade Blvd, and Dry Pocket Rd are flooding,\nincluding areas of the Thornblade Golf Club.\n\n* The following streamgauge has exceeded Action/Advisory Stage:\nMiddle Tyger River at Mt. Lebanon Church Rd. west of Gramling.\n\nCurrent Stage: 9.16 feet and cresting\nForecast: Middle Tyger River will continue to recede this evening\nfalling below Action/Advisory Stage later tonight.\nAction Stage: 7.5 feet.\nMinor Flood Stage: 10.5 feet.\nImpacts: At 9.0 feet, Action/Advisory Stage flooding continues.\nResin Creek is flooding near its confluence with the Middle Tyger\nRiver, partially flooding Mt. Lebanon Church Rd. immediately west\nof the gauge site with up to 3-6 inches of water.\n\n* Some locations that may continue to experience flooding include...\nGreenville Downtown, Greenville Eastside, West Greenville, Greer,\nMauldin, Taylors, Berea, Five Forks, Welcome and Travelers Rest.",
