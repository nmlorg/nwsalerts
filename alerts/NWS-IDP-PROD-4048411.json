        "description": "Snow will continue across the southern North Carolina Piedmont and\neastern South Carolina Piedmont this afternoon. Snow rates will\nmostly be light, although an occasional burst of moderate snow\nwill be possible. Snow accumulations should generally be limited\nto a dusting in most locations. However, isolated amounts of up to\nan inch will be possible, especially south of I-85. Most areas\nwill remain above freezing, and significant travel impacts are\ntherefore not expected, but a few slippery spots could develop on\nelevated surfaces, such as bridges and overpasses.",
