        "description": "Several rounds of heavy rainfall are expected between Monday and\nThursday as a series of disturbances interact with a stalled\nfrontal boundary. Thunderstorms are also expected during this time\nand will locally increase rainfall amounts. The combination of\nsaturated soils from recent rainfall, and many rivers, creeks, and\nstreams still recovering, will increase the threat for flooding.\nFlash flooding is also possible during heavy downpours.\n\nRainfall totals Monday and Tuesday could reach 2 to 3 inches,\nwith another 2 to 3 inches possible Wednesday and Thursday. It is\nimportant to note that these values may change depending on\nexactly where the front stalls.\n\nA Flash Flood Watch or Areal Flood Watch may be required for\nportions of northern Alabama and southern middle Tennessee next\nweek. Residents should continue to monitor this unfolding weather\nsituation over the holiday weekend and stay tuned to further\nforecast updates from the National Weather Service.\n\nFor additional hydrologic information, visit our website at\nweather.gov/huntsville.",
