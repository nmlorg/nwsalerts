        "description": "A potent short wave trough will continue bring shower activity\nacross the mountains this morning, lingering into the early\nafternoon near the Tennessee border. Steep mid-level lapse rates\nwill support heavier showers with reduced visibilities at times\nwith even an isolated thunderstorm or two possible. Snow levels\nare expected to remain around 5000 feet, but may briefly drop down\nto 4000 feet in heavier bands. An additional dusting to an inch\nof snow is possible, mainly above 5000 feet.\n\nUse caution if traveling today across the southern and central\nmountains of western North Carolina.",
