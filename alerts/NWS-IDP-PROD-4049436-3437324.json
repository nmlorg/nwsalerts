        "description": "...An Extended Period of Rainfall May Lead to Flooding over North\nMississippi and Portions of Southwest Tennessee Near the Tennessee\nRiver Monday and Tuesday...\n\n.A cold front will pass through the Midsouth on Monday and become\nnearly stationary over central Mississippi Monday night. Showers\nand thunderstorms will bring periods of moderate rainfall prior\nto frontal passage Monday afternoon. As moisture from the Gulf of\nMexico intersects the stationary front over central Mississippi\nMonday night, the likelihood of persistent moderate to heavy rain\nwill increase north of the front. By Tuesday afternoon, rainfall\nof 3 to 5 inches will be possible, mainly south of a Clarksdale\nto Oxford to Tupelo line. Soils will be near saturation at the\nonset of rainfall Monday. In addition to lowland flooding, river\nflooding will be possible over north Mississippi and along the\nTennessee River, into southwest Tennessee.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Memphis has issued a\n\n* Flood Watch for portions of North Mississippi and West\nTennessee, including the following areas, in North\nMississippi, Calhoun, Chickasaw, Coahoma, Itawamba, Lafayette,\nLee, Monroe, Panola, Pontotoc, Prentiss, Quitman,\nTallahatchie, Tishomingo, Union, and Yalobusha. In West\nTennessee, Hardin.\n\n* From Monday morning through Tuesday afternoon.\n\n* Rainfall of 3 to 5 inches with locally higher amounts are\npossible, with pre-event soils near saturation.\n\n* Low-lying areas and areas adjacent to rivers may flood.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
