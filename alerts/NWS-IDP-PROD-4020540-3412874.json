        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nEast Fork White River...Eel River...Wabash River...White River...\n\n\n.Minor to moderate flooding continued Sunday morning in central and\nsouthern Indiana on the major rivers.  Crests will be/are comparable\nto those that occurred in February and June of 2019.  Minor\nflooding developed late Saturday afternoon on the Eel River that\nwill come to an end this afternoon.\n\nA mix of precipitation Friday and Saturday totaled as high as\napproximately 1.50 inches, which will slow river falls or bring\nlower secondary crests on the major rivers, and produce additional\nminor flooding on smaller ones.  Flooding has returned to Seymour on\nthe East Fork White River, and this afternoon it will return to\nSpencer on the White River.  The Driftwood River near Edinburgh will\nbe near bankfull, with a crest near flood stage Sunday morning.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers will\ncontinue until about Wednesday, January 29.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is forecast through midday Thursday.  This\nwill give area waterways several days to drain and return to near\nnormal levels.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River at Petersburg.\n* until Tuesday January 28.\n* At 9:30 AM Sunday the stage was 24.6 feet.\n* Flood stage is 16.0 feet.\n* Moderate flooding is occurring and Moderate flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by Monday\nJanuary 27.\n* At 24.2 feet...During April 2013 when Petersburg reached this level,\nthe water only reached the white line of SR 257 south of\nWashington, but never closed the road.  Shoals only went to 11.67\nfeet during April 2013.  This is the first that locals can remember\nsuch a high stage for Petersburg and SR 257 remaining open.",
        "instruction": "Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...\n\nMotorists should never drive into flood water. Turn around and go\nanother way. Keep children away from flooded areas. Recreational and\nagricultural interests should remain alert to changing river\nconditions.\n\nFor detailed flood information go to weather.gov/ind on the web and\nclick on rivers and lakes.",
