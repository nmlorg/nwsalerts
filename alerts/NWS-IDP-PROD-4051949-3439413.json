Gages indicate rising water levels in rivers and\nstreams across the island.\n\nLocations in the advisory include but are not limited to...\nKilauea, Anahola, Wailua, Hanalei, Na Pali State Park, Wainiha, North\nFork Wailua Trails, Moloaa, Princeville, Polihale, Kokee State Park\nand Wailua Homesteads.",

Turn around, don't drown.",
