For the Gale Warning period, northwest winds 25 to 35\nkt with gusts up to 45 kt and seas 12 to 14 feet at 11 seconds.\nFor the Hazardous Seas Warning, very steep and hazardous seas\naround 14 feet at 10 seconds expected. For the Hazardous Seas\nWatch, very steep and hazardous seas 20 to 25 feet at 16 seconds\npossible.\n\n* WHERE...All hazards will affect all of the area except for the\nGale Warning, which is in effect for all except the northeastern\nquarter of the area.\n\n* WHEN...For the Small Craft Advisory, until 4 AM PST Thursday. For\nthe Gale Warning, from 10 PM this evening to 10 AM PST\nThursday. For the Hazardous Seas Warning, from 4 AM to 10 AM PST\nThursday. For the Hazardous Seas Watch, from Friday afternoon\nthrough Sunday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...During the advisory period, small boats and\ninexperienced mariners could encounter conditions that could\njeopardize safety. During the warning and watch periods, strong\nwinds and very steep seas could damage or displace fishing gear.\nVery steep and hazardous seas could capsize or damage vessels.\n\n* View the hazard area in detail at\nhttps://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mfr/HAZARD",
        "instruction": "Mariners should alter plans to avoid strong winds and very steep\nseas. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or\nsecure the vessel for severe conditions.\n\nA Small Craft Advisory means that winds and seas will create a\npotential hazard to smaller vessels and inexperienced mariners.\n\nA Gale Warning means winds of 34 to 47 knots are imminent or\noccurring. Operating a vessel in gale conditions requires\nexperience and properly equipped vessels. It is highly recommended\nthat mariners without the proper experience seek safe harbor prior\nto the onset of gale conditions.\n\nA Hazardous Seas Warning means very steep and hazardous sea\nconditions are imminent or occurring. Recreational boaters should\nremain in port, or take shelter until waves subside.  Commercial\nvessels should prepare for rough seas and consider remaining in\nport or taking shelter in port until hazardous seas subside.\n\nA Hazardous Seas Watch is issued when the risk of very steep and\nhazardous seas has significantly increased, but the specific\ntiming and/or location is still uncertain. It is intended to\nprovide additional lead time for mariners who may wish to\nconsider altering their plans.",
