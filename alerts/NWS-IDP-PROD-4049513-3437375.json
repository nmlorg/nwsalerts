        "description": "...HEAVY SNOW EXPECTED ACROSS CENTRAL AND EAST-CENTRAL WISCONSIN\nTODAY...\n\n.A low pressure system located over extreme southeast South Dakota\nearly this morning will track to northeast Iowa by noon, then\nalong the Wisconsin/Illinois border this afternoon. This is a\nrather compact but vigorous storm system, and will bring a\nsignificant snowfall to all but far northern Wisconsin. The storm\nis also fast moving, so snow will quickly overspread the area\nduring the morning, but also diminish quickly from west to east\nduring the late afternoon and evening.\n\nAlthough winds are not expected to be strong during the storm, the\nheavy snowfall could reduce the visibility to under 1/4 mile at\ntimes, especially in central and east-central Wisconsin. This will\nlikely result in hazardous travel conditions. Air travel is also\nlikely to be affected by the storm.\n\n* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches,\nwith slightly lower totals north of Rhinelander.\n\n* WHERE...Langlade, Lincoln, Forest and Oneida Counties.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel will become hazardous.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow is expected to develop between 700 am\nand 1000 am, and the intensity of the snow will increase\nquickly. This will result in rapidly deteriorating travel\nconditions during morning.",
        "instruction": "If traveling today, expect to encounter roads that are snow\ncovered and slippery, and allow plenty of time to reach your\ndestination. The latest road conditions can be obtained by\ncalling 5 1 1.",
