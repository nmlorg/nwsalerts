Moderate flooding continues at Mount\nCarmel on the lower Wabash, but the river is is expected to fall to\nthe minor flood category Friday afternoon.\n\nFlooding on the White River, which is now confined to Petersburg,\nsouthward, will end early this coming week.  We expect to see minor\nrises again on the Wabash due to the current weather system moving\nthrough.  This will prolong flooding a bit longer, lasting as long as\nThursday, January 30.  Another weather system is due by the end of\nthe month.  Is is too early to tell if this will have an effect on\narea waterways.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Riverton.\n* until Thursday January 30.\n* At 10:00 PM Thursday the stage was 19.8 feet.\n* Flood stage is 15.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by\nThursday January 30.\n* At 20.0 feet...Extensive flooding is in progress.  Higher rural\nroads begin to flood.  High water isolates many river cabins.  Seep\nwater becomes a problem.",
