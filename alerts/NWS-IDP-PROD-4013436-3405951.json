Total snow accumulations of\nup to one inch and ice accumulations up two tenths of an inch.\nWinds gusting as high as 35 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Central, South Central and Southeast Kansas.\n\n* WHEN...From 5 PM Thursday to noon CST Friday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Slick roads, parking lots, and sidewalks are\nexpected. Even a small amount of ice accumulation can create\nhazardous conditions and could impact the Thursday evening and\nFriday morning commutes.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...In south central and southeast Kansas, snow\nfollowed by mixed precipitation is expected Thursday afternoon\nand early evening while freezing rain appears more likely late\nevening and overnight. In central Kansas, snow and sleet is\nexpected to persist longer before mixing with freezing rain and\nrain. Therefore, the main concern at this time for southern\nareas within the advisory will be lighter snow amounts but\ngreater ice accumulation of around two tenths of an inch from\nfreezing rain. Further north in central Kansas, lighter ice\naccumulation but potentially a heavier snow/sleet accumulation\nwill be the primary concern.",
