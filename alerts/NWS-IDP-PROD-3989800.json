        "description": "...PROLONGED PERIOD OF ABOVE NORMAL RAINFALL LIKELY TO CONTINUE\nTHROUGH MID-LATE JANUARY...\n\nThe latest forecasts continue to indicate an increasing likelihood\nof heavy rainfall and flooding issues late this week and into the\nweekend. A cold front will approach the region on Friday and then\nstall out across the region. A secondary storm system is forecast\nto develop and then move northeastward along this stalled out\nfront and will bring multiple rounds of moderate to heavy rainfall\nto the region. Some thunderstorms will also be possible in this\nsetup which could bring locally higher amounts of rainfall to some\nareas.\n\nThe latest forecasts still suggesting an axis of heavy\nprecipitation will develop over portions of the region. Within\nthis band 3 to 5 inches of rainfall could occur with locally\nhigher amounts. At this time, there is still considerable\nuncertainty on where this heavy rainfall axis will set up.\n\nSoil conditions across the region are nearly saturated due to\nrecent rainfall events over the past few weeks. The additional\nrainfall expected late in the week will likely result in flooding\nproblems developing this weekend. These flooding problems could\ndevelop very quickly in some areas. The highest risk of flooding\nwill be in areas that are low-lying and have very poor drainage.\nIn addition, area low water crossings will be under the threat of\nflooding.\n\nWater levels on area rivers are high and are running above normal\nwinter pool levels. The additional rainfall expected later this\nweek will likely push these rivers higher and some forecast points\nwill go into flood as early as this weekend and then continue\nnext week.\n\nLooking beyond this weekend, the long range forecasts indicate\nthat several more systems could impact the region next week with\nadditional rounds of moderate to heavy rainfall. Should these\nheavy rainfall events materialize, there is a high probability\nthat river flooding will become an increasing problem for the\nremainder of January.\n\nStay tuned to NOAA All Hazards Radio and your local media for the\nlatest on this potentially significant heavy rainfall and\nflooding event.",
