        "description": "Lowland snowmelt last week and recent rainfall has increased soil\nmoisture to high levels across western Washington. The ground\nremains at threshold levels of saturation, and ongoing moderate\nto heavy rainfall continuing through Friday will put extra\npressure on soil instability, leading to an increased threat of\nlandslides. Additional rainfall amounts of one half inch to two\ninches are expected through Friday.\n\nAt least a few landslides has already been reported yesterday and\ntoday. More landslides remain possible.\n\nAreas above 6000 feet in elevation will see mostly snow and not be\naffected.\n\nFor more information about current conditions, visit\nwww.weather.gov/seattle, select Hydrology, and then scroll down\nfor the links to the landslide information pages.\n\nFor more information on landslides, visit the website for the\nWashington State Department of Natural Resources landslide\ngeologic hazards at: http://bit.ly/2mtA3wn",
