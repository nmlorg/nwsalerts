In addition, periods of strong and gusty winds will\ncreate areas of blowing snow in central New Mexico focusing\nthrough the middle Rio Grande Valley from Santa Fe to Albuquerque\nto Socorro.

Total snow accumulations of 1 to 6\ninches. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph around Santa Fe and\nGlorieta Pass, and as high as 60 mph below Tijeras Canyon in\nAlbuquerque. Lowest snowfall amounts will be below canyons,\nwhile higher amounts are expected around northwest Rio Rancho\nand northern portions of Santa Fe.\n\n* WHERE...Glorieta Mesa Including Glorieta Pass, Santa Fe Metro\nArea and Middle Rio Grande Valley including the Albuquerque\nMetro Area.\n\n* WHEN...From 11 PM this evening to 11 PM MST Tuesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing\nsnow could significantly reduce visibility. Gusty winds could\nbring down tree branches. Snow amounts will be highly variable\nfrom the snow hole effect.",
