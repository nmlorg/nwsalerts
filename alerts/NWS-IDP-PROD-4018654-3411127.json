The river was cresting at Riverton on Friday, but\nnow with the additional precipitation runoff the crest will be\ndelayed until Sunday afternoon.  Vincennes will crest at 20.8\nfeet Monday afternoon.  Mount Carmel will crest Monday at 28.0\nfeet.  The White River is cresting at Petersburg and Hazleton.\nThe crest on the East Fork White is now downstream of Shoals.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers\nwill continue until the last few days of the month.\n\nOur next precipitation event is forecast to come Friday, thus we\nwill have 5 plus days of dry weather allowing drainage of area\nwaterways.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Mount Carmel.\n* until further notice.\n* At 8:45 AM Saturday the stage was 27.2 feet.\n* Flood stage is 19.0 feet.\n* Moderate flooding is occurring and Moderate flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue rising to near 28.0 feet by Monday\nafternoon then begin falling.\n* At 28.0 feet...Critical Stage of Rochester-Mcleary Bluff Levee.\nCattle and farm equipment must be moved.
