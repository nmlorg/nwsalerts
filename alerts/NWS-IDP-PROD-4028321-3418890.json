        "description": "* WHAT...For the Beach Hazards Statement, large breaking waves of\naround 5 feet in a long period swell. For the High Rip Current\nRisk, frequent strong and dangerous rip currents will occur as\nsignificant wave energy will be piling in behind the sand bar\ntoday. This will create numerous breaches and channels for rips\nto form in the surf zone.\n\n* WHERE...Volusia, Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie, and Martin\nCounties.\n\n* WHEN...Through 7 PM this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away\nfrom shore into deeper water. large breaking waves can knock you\ndown and make you even more susceptible to being caught in the\nseaward pull of a rip current.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...High tide will occur this morning around\n900 AM. While rip currents will be present all day, they will be\nmore frequent and pull especially strong between 12 noon and 600\nPM due to tidal effects.",
        "instruction": "Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away\nfrom shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the\nsandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and\npiers. Heed the advice of lifeguards. Entering the ocean is not\nadvised today due to both the dangerous surf conditions and the\nfrequent, strong rip current activity.",
