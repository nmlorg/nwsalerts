The river will crest next around midnight Tuesday night at\nCovington and Terre Haute.  The crest on the White River was\napproaching Elliston.  The crest along the East Fork White River was\nbetween Seymour and Rivervale. Flooding along the lower portions of\nthe White and Wabash River is likely to continue through the end of\nthe month.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday which\nwill allow smaller rivers to continue to recede this week.\nAbove normal precipitation is possible this coming Friday\ninto Saturday, which could exacerbate elevated water levels on area\nwaterways.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River at Seymour.\n* until Friday morning.\n* At  7:45 PM Monday the stage was 17.6 feet.\n* Flood stage is 12.0 feet.\n* Moderate flooding is occurring and Moderate flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by\nThursday evening.\n* At 17.5 feet...Extensive agricultural flooding in progress.
