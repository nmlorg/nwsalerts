Streams within this area are running high, and\nrainfall is expected to continue through the day.\n\n* Locations in the advisory include but are not limited to...\nHilo, Paauilo, Waipio Valley, Orchidland Estates, Pepeekeo, Keaau,\nHonokaa, Hawaiian Paradise Park, Pahoa, Kapaau, Hawaiian Acres,\nGlenwood, and Mountain View.",

Turn around, don't drown.",
