Additionally,\nbreaking wave heights of 15 to 22 feet will be possible at\nfavored locations along the shore. The swell will begin to\ndecrease tonight, but breaking waves heights up to 12 to 20 feet\nwill remain possible through Friday morning.\n\n* WHAT...Increased risk of sneaker waves, rip currents, long shore\ncurrents, and large shore break are expected.\n\n* WHERE...San Francisco, Coastal North Bay Including Point Reyes\nNational Seashore, San Francisco Peninsula Coast, Northern\nMonterey Bay and Southern Monterey Bay and Big Sur Coast\nCounties.\n\n* WHEN...Now through Friday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to\nsea.
