For the Small Craft Advisory, northeast\nwinds 10 to 15 knots with gusts up to 25 knots and waves 2 to\n4 feet.\n\n* WHERE...Grand Portage to Grand Marais MN.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, until 9 AM CST\nthis morning. For the Small Craft Advisory, until 10 PM CST\nthis evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
