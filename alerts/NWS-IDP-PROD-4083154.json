This\nweekend temperatures could potentially reach into the lower 40s on\nSaturday ahead of a cold front for Sunday. This temperature\npattern will aid in ripening the snowpack across the area but with\nlow temperatures overnight falling back below freezing any melt\nwater is not expected to begin making its way into the river\nsystems.\n\nAlthough a few windy clipper systems will move across the area\nthis week no major precipitation systems are expected to impact\nthe region through the end of the week and into the weekend.",
