For the Gale Warning, west gales to\naround 40 knots and waves 9 to 14 feet expected on Saturday\nafternoon and night.\n\n* WHERE...St Joseph to Manistee MI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 4 PM\nSaturday to 1 PM EST Sunday. For the Gale Warning, from 1 AM\nSaturday to 10 AM EST Sunday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Winds and waves will peak Saturday\nevening. Heavy freezing spray is expected from Saturday\nevening into Sunday morning.",
