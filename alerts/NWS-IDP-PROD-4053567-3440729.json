However, flood waters\nremained in the ditches along the highway, and fluctuations in\nriver levels could flood Highway 275 very quickly. Thus the Flood\nWarning has been extended through at least Friday as melting both\nTuesday and Wednesday could aid in rising river levels.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nScribner and Dead Timber State Recreation Area.",
