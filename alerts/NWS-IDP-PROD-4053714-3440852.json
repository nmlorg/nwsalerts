        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nDriftwood River...East Fork White River...Eel River...Sugar Creek...\nWabash River...White River...\n\n\n.Flooding is underway along several central and southern Indiana\nwaterways as a result of up to 2 inches of precipitation that fell\nSunday into Monday.  The core of heaviest precipitation occurred\nwithin 50 miles north and south of Interstate 70 across the state.\nThe bulk of the water will show up in the White River south of\nIndianapolis, where crests are expected to be up to about 5 feet\nabove flood stage.  Flooding along the lower reaches of the Wabash\nand White Rivers currently are predicted to last until the end of\nnext week.\n\nThe latest forecast model data is now predicting flood crests along\nthe White River to be lower than what was predicted Monday morning.\nThis will give us crests lower than what we saw in January.\nPredictions for the Wabash are very similiar to Monday's\npredictions.\n\nFlood impacts should mainly be confined to roads near the waterways,\nagricultural land, bottomlands, and levees.  Please see the specific\nimpacts listed for your location of interest below or by going to\nthe web page described below.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Terre Haute.\n* until Tuesday February 18.\n* At 11:30 AM Tuesday the stage was 16.0 feet. This is 2.0 to 2.5\nfeet higher than the observations from the old legacy gauge.\n* Flood stage is 16.5 feet. This is 2.5 feet higher than flood stage\nfrom the old legacy gauge.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...Rise above flood stage by Thursday afternoon and\ncontinue to rise to near 16.2 feet by late tonight  and will rise\nlater to 18.7 by Saturday morning. It will fall below flood stage\nby Tuesday February 18.\n* At 18.5 feet...Flooding of rural roads is in progress behind Honey\nCreek Levee as a result of two unrepaired levee breaks.",
        "instruction": "Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...\n\nMotorists should never drive into flood water. Turn around and go\nanother way. Keep children away from flooded areas. Recreational and\nagricultural interests should remain alert to changing river\nconditions.\n\nFor detailed flood information go to weather.gov/ind on the web and\nclick on rivers and lakes.",
