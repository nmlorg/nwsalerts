        "description": "There was some melting that occurred on the roads yesterday\nafternoon from the snow, but as the sun went down temperatures\ndropped into the teens and 20's. This is causing refreezing on\nroadways, especially ones that haven't been treated. Areas of\nblack ice will develop and make roads very slippery. In addition,\nfreezing fog is possible across the Permian Basin where the\nheaviest snow fell. If you encounter fog, visibilities may quickly\ndrop. Use caution while driving through the morning hours and\ngive yourself plenty of time to get to where you are going.",
