        "description": "A strong northwesterly jet will traverse the region overnight in\nassociation with an upper-level disturbance passing across the\narea. Winds aloft are quite strong and some of these winds are\nmixing down to the surface in the higher terrain of southwest\nVirginia and northwest North Carolina, especially from areas such\nas Boone, to Jefferson, to Hillsville and adjacent areas along and\nnear the Blue Ridge.\n\nWind gusts as high as 45 to 50 mph will be possible in the higher\nterrain across Watauga, Ashe, Grayson, Alleghany, Carroll, Floyd,\nand Wythe counties through the early morning hours.\n\nMotorists, especially those driving high profile vehicles, are\nurged to drive with extreme caution. These strong winds will\nimpact the higher terrain through the Interstate 77 corridor from\njust north of the North Carolina/Virginia border northward to\nWytheville. High profile vehicles should exercise extreme caution\ntraveling through this area and in fact may want to avoid travel\nthrough this region until the winds subside after daybreak.\n\nStay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio or Commercial Radio and\nTelevision for the latest weather information.",
