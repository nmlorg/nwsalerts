In southeast Arkansas, Arkansas, Bradley,\nCleveland, Desha, Drew, Jefferson, and Lincoln. In southwest\nArkansas, Calhoun, Dallas, and Ouachita.\n\n* Through Tuesday afternoon\n\n* Periods of showers and thunderstorms will continue over southern\nand southeast Arkansas through Tuesday. Already, rainfall of one\nto two inches has occured in the last 24 hours. An additional\none to two inch rainfall is likely in the next 24 hours, with\nlocalized amounts exceeding two inches. With an already\nsaturated ground, flash flooding may occur.\n\n* Since vegetation is dormant, and not consuming much ground\nwater, runoff from heavy rain will be increased. This elevates\nthe concern for flash flooding. Also, rapid rises may occur on\ncreeks, small streams, and flashy rivers.",
