Over the\npast 6 hours the area has received widespread 1-1.25 inches of\nrainfall, with storm-total rainfall of 1.5-2 inches since 7am\nMonday morning.\n\n* Additional rainfall of 1-3 inches is possible overnight tonight\nthrough early Tuesday afternoon.  This will exacerbate ongoing\nflooding and cause new flooding to develop.  This area may be\nupgraded to a Flash Flood Warning if a new round of heavy\nrainfall develops overnight. Residents within low-lying areas,\nespecially adjacent to streams, are encouraged to stay weather\naware and have a way to receive NWS warnings.  Drivers are urged\nto obey all barricades and avoid flooded roadways.\n\n* The following streamgauge will exceed Action/Advisory Stage by\n11pm:\nSoque River at GA 197 near Clarkesville.\n\nCURRENT Stage: 10.53 feet and rising rapidly.\nFORECAST: The Soque River will continue to rise to between\n12-13 feet 1-3 hours.  Additional rises are possible overnight.\n\nACTION/ADVISORY Stage: 11.0 feet.\nMINOR Flood Stage: 13.0 feet.\n\nIMPACTS: Between 11 and 13 feet, the Soque River will begin\nflooding low-lying areas adjacent to the river near Clarkesville,\nincluding Pitts City Park.\n\n* The headwaters of the Tallulah River are also exceeding bankfull\nand flooding of adjacent low-lying areas is beginning.  Expect\nadditional releases downstream within the North Georgia reservoir\nsystem overnight tonight.\n\n* Some locations that may experience flooding include...\nClayton, Clarkesville, Cornelia, Baldwin, Demorest, Mount Airy,\nAlto, Mountain City, Tiger and Dillard.",
        "instruction": "Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the\ndangers of flooding.\n\nIn hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are\npotentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded\nroads. Turn around, dont drown.",
