The first round of rain and isolated\nthunderstorms will arrive early Tuesday morning and continue\nthrough late Tuesday night. A second round of rain will affect\nthe area Wednesday into Wednesday night. Additional light\nprecipitation is possible Thursday as well. Rainfall totals\nranging from 1.5 to 2.5 inches are expected by Thursday.\n\nWhile rainfall over the the last two weeks has been minor, many\nrivers and streams remain at or near bankfull from widespread\nheavy rainfall during the first half of January. Additionally,\nsoil moisture values remain elevated.\n\nWhile widespread flooding is not anticipated, flooding of low-\nlying and poorly-drained areas could occur. Low water crossings\nwould also be at risk of flooding. Small streams and rivers may\nreturn to bankfull. Those with interests in flood-prone areas or\nalong small streams should prepare for possible flooding this\nweek.",
