For the Small Craft Advisory,\nnorth winds 20 to 25 kt with gusts up to 30 kt and waves 5 to\n8 feet expected.\n\n* WHERE...Port Washington to North Point Light WI, North Point\nLight to Wind Point WI and Wind Point WI to Winthrop Harbor IL.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 3 AM\nThursday to midnight CST Thursday night. For the Small Craft\nAdvisory, from midnight tonight to 6 PM CST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
