The surf zone will be dangerous due\nto strong currents and powerful breaking waves. This threat\nwill be maximized on steeply sloped beaches. Rip currents can\npull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can\ncause injury, wash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize\nsmall boats near shore.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Swell heights 11 to 14 feet at 20 to 22\nseconds. This will generate breaking waves of 20 to 25 feet,\nfavored locations may exceed 25 feet.",
