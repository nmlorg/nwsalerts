        "description": "A band of moderate snow is pushing northeast out of east central\nIndiana and southwest Ohio toward central Ohio. This band of snow\nwill bring reduced visibilities to below a mile as it moves\nthrough. In addition, the snow may mix with sleet or rain at\ntimes. Accumulations will remain below a half an inch, mainly on\ngrassy and elevated surfaces. Roads are not expected to be\nimpacted. The snow could change to rain before ending. Steadier\nrain will then move in later this evening.\n\nBe prepared for rapidly changing visibilities in falling snow\nacross the area through the late afternoon hours.",
