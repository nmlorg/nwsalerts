        "description": "At 113 AM EST, Doppler radar was tracking a line of developing\nthunderstorms across western Johnston and eastern Cumberland\nCounties including a strong thunderstorm across southeastern\nCumberland County, moving northeast at 50 mph.\n\nVery heavy rain and wind gusts up to 40 mph are possible with these\nstorms. The strongest thunderstorm will move from southeastern\nCumberland County into western and northern Sampson County through\n200 AM.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nGoldsboro, Smithfield, Clinton, Dunn, Mount Olive, Benson, Fremont,\nWalnut Creek, Godwin and Micro.",
        "instruction": "Locally heavy rain will quickly reduce visibility and result in\nponding of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and\nminor flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.\nDrivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid\nhydroplaning, especially in urban areas where prolonged heavy rain\ncan quickly lead to flooding.",
