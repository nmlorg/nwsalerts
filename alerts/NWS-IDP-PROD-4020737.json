Winds are expected to remain westerly through the day,\nturning more northwesterly this afternoon which should carry the\nplume out over marine areas.\n\nThe trace or dusting of volcanic ash will remain over mainly open\nwaters.",
        "instruction": "Ash is an eye and respiratory irritant and is abrasive. Those with\nrespiratory sensitivities should take extra precautions to minimize\nexposure. Protect electronics and cover air intakes if ashfall is\nexpected or confirmed. Remove ash from surfaces with water if\npossible to prevent excessive accumulation.",
