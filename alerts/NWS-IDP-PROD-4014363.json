        "description": "Recent very cold temperatures have allowed some ice to form on\nrivers and streams. Below normal temperatures are expected to\ncontinue into the weekend, so waterways may continue to build ice\nor freeze up. In some locations this could result in freeze up ice\njam formation and localized flooding. Freeze up type ice jams are\ntypically short lived but can result in rapid water rises. Warmer\ntemperatures are expected next week.\n\nThose living near waterways should pay close attention to the\nstate of the ice, move livestock and equipment away from low\nlying areas, and be prepared to seek higher ground should waters\nrise.\n\nIf ice jam flooding does develop please report it to local law\nenforcement, and have them pass it on to the National Weather\nService.",
