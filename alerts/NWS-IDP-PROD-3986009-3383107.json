        "description": "* At 225 PM EST, Doppler radar indicates the earlier heavy rainfall\nhas ended across central Greenville County; however, an area of 1-3\ninches of rainfall occurred between approximately 10:30am and noon,\ncausing flooding of low-lying areas and several roadways.\n\n* Several reports of flooded roads have been received by local media\nand law enforcement.  These roads include: Spartanburg St, Hilly St,\nthe Swamp Rabbit Trail at River St, Lakehurst St, Byrdland Dr, and\nWest Blue Ridge Dr. Roadway flooding of less than 12\" depth may\ncontinue for a few more hours as runoff continues to work through\narea streams and poorly draining areas.  It is important to\ncontinue to heed all barricades and seek an alternative route.\n\n* Area streams continue to rise, though cresting should be imminent\nfor most streams.  Nevertheless, additional flooding adjacent to\nstreams is likely over the next few hours as it takes a while for\nexcessive runoff to work through the soils and into adjacent\nstreams.  Therefore, avoid streams and adjacent areas through the\nevening hours.\n\n* The following streamgauges have exceeded Minor Flood Stage:\nReedy River at Hudson St and Reedy River at Westfield St.\n\nCurrent Stage: 9.40 feet and rising slowly.\nForecast: Reedy Creek will rise to between 10 and 11 feet before\ncresting later this afternoon.\nAction Stage: 8.0 feet.\nMinor Flood Stage: 9.0 feet.\nImpacts: At 10.0 feet, low-lying areas along the Reedy River and\nSwamp Rabbit Trail between E Bramlett Rd and Newtown Park to River\nSt to Reedy River Falls Park and Cleveland Park will be flooding.\nExpect closures to the Swamp Rabbit Trail and Cleveland Park.\n\n* The following streamgauge has exceeded Action/Advisory Stage:\nBrushy Creek near Boiling Springs Rd in Taylors.\n\nCurrent Stage: 9.00 feet and rising steadily.\nForecast: Brushy Creek will continue to rise to between 10.0 feet\nand 10.5 feet before cresting later this afternoon.\nAction Stage: 8.5 feet.\nMinor Flood Stage: 10.0 feet.\nImpacts: At 10.0 feet, low-lying areas along Brushy Creek from\nOld Spartanburg Hwy to Scottswood Rd, Ellesmere Dr, Devenger Rd,\nThornblade Blvd, and Dry Pocket Rd are flooding, including areas\nof the Thornblade Golf Club.\n\n* Some locations that will continue to experience flooding include...\nGreenville Downtown, Greenville Eastside, West Greenville, Greer,\nMauldin, Taylors, Berea, Five Forks, Welcome and Travelers Rest.\n\n* Additional heavy rainfall is possible this afternoon and evening.\nGiven the very wet antecedent conditions, any additional heavy\nrainfall may prompt new rounds of flooding.  Please stay weather\naware.",
        "instruction": "Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nHeavy rainfall is causing significant ponding of water in urban\nareas, streets and underpasses, as well as other poor drainage areas\nand low-lying spots. Rapid rises on small creeks and streams is\noccurring, possibly flooding low-water crossings and farmland. Do\nnot attempt to travel across flooded roads.",
