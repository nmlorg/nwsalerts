        "description": "The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued a\n\n* Flood Advisory for...\nHart County in northeastern Georgia...\nCentral Anderson County in Upstate South Carolina...\nPickens County in Upstate South Carolina...\n\n* Until 1130 AM EST Tuesday.\n\n* At 522 AM EST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated\nrounds of moderate rainfall are returning to Anderson, Hart, and\nPickens counties after a quieter past 6 hours, when less than a\nquarter inch of rainfall occurred.  The lighter rainfall allowed\nstreams to crest following widespread storm-total rainfall of 1-2\ninches since 7am Monday morning.  However, latest radar trends\nsuggest an additional 0.50-1 inch of rainfall is possible over the\nimmediate 1-2 hours. This additional rainfall over saturated soils\nwill induce new runoff which will likely keep streams elevated and\ncause nuisance flooding of low-lying areas to develop shortly.\n\n* Additional rainfall of 1-2 inches is possible early Tuesday\nmorning through Tuesday afternoon.  This will exacerbate ongoing\nflooding and may cause new flooding to develop.  This area may be\nupgraded to a Flash Flood Warning if additional heavy\nrainfall develops. Residents within low-lying areas, especially\nadjacent to streams, are encouraged to stay weather aware and have\na way to receive NWS warnings.  Drivers are urged to obey all\nbarricades and avoid flooded roadways.\n\n* Some locations that may experience flooding include...\nAnderson, Easley, Clemson, Hartwell, Pickens, Homeland Park,\nPowdersville, Central, Northlake and Pendleton.",
        "instruction": "Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the\ndangers of flooding.\n\nIn hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are\npotentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded\nroads. Turn around, dont drown.\n\nIf heavy rainfall continues, the advisory may be upgraded to a Flash\nFlood Warning. People in flood prone areas, especially along creeks\nand small streams, should prepare to move to higher ground quickly if\na Flash Flood Warning is issued.",
