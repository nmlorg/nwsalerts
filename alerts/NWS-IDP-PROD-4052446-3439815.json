In west central\nGeorgia...Coweta and Heard.\n\n* Through Tuesday evening\n\n* The first round of moderate to heavy rain began moving across\nthe region Monday afternoon and will continue through midday\nTuesday. Two to three inches of total rain is expected with\nlocally higher amounts. With saturated soils and very high\nstreamflows already in place across the region, runoff from the\nadditional rain will be enhanced, leading to a greater threat of\nflash flooding.\n\n\n* Flash flooding and minor to moderate flooding of larger creeks\nand rivers is expected. This will close some roads and could\nflood homes and businesses in flood-prone areas. Along larger\ncreeks and rivers, flooding could last for several days.",
