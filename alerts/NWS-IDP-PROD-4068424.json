        "description": "This is the fourth in the series of regularly scheduled\nhydrologic outlooks issued during the Winter and Spring season.\nThis outlook is designed to provide a general overview of river\nflood potential (not flash flooding) across Central New York and\nNortheast Pennsylvania for the next two weeks...February 20th to\nMarch 5th.\n\n...SUMMARY...\n\nAlthough snow cover has increased across the Central New York\nbasins, snow depths and water equivalent remain generally only\nnear to below average in most locations, and especially across\nNortheast Pennsylvania. The major rivers and headwater tributaries\nare running slightly higher than typical for this time of year,\nbut there is no significant ice cover. Ground states remain\nunusually moist and partially frozen. With a lack of significant\nrainfall, or warmer than seasonally average temperatures expected\nfor the next two weeks, the overall assessment of the flood\npotential for the NWS Binghamton hydrologic outlook area is BELOW\nAVERAGE.\n\n...CURRENT CONDITIONS...\n\n.CHEMUNG BASIN...\n.Precipitation (past 14 days): Above average.\n.Snow Cover: Below average. Local areas near average.\n.Snow Water Equivalent: Below average. Local areas near average.\n.14-Day Average Streamflow: Average to above average\n.River Ice: Below normal. No ice.\n.Ground State: Very moist. Partially frozen.\n\n.NORTH BRANCH SUSQUEHANNA BASIN (NY)...\n.Precipitation (past 14 days): Above average.\n.Snow Cover: Below average. Local headwaters above average.\n.Snow Water Equivalent: Below average. Local headwaters above average.\n.14-Day Average Streamflow...Above average.\n.River Ice...Below normal. No ice.\n.Ground State... Very moist. Partially frozen.\n\n.UPPER MAIN STEM SUSQUEHANNA BASIN (PA)...\n.Precipitation (past 14 days)...Above average.\n.Snow Cover...Below average.\n.Water Equivalent...Below average.\n.14-day Average Streamflow...Above average.\n.River Ice...Below normal. No ice.\n.Ground State...Unusually moist. Partially frozen.\n\n.UPPER DELAWARE BASIN...\n.Precipitation (past 14 days)...Above average.\n.Snow Cover...Below average.\n.Water Equivalent...Below average.\n.14-Day Avg. Streamflow...Much above average.\n.River Ice...Below normal. No ice.\n.Reservoir Levels...Above the long term median.\n.Ground State...Unusually moist. Partially frozen.\n\n.OSWEGO DRAINAGE / FINGER LAKES...\n.Precipitation (past 14 days)...Above average.\n.Snow Cover...Below average.\n.Water Equivalent...Below average.\n.14-Day Average Streamflow...Average.\n.River Ice...Below normal. No ice.\n.Lake Levels...Normal winter pools.\n.Ground State...Extremely moist. Partially frozen.\n\n...FORECAST OUTLOOK...\n\n.FUTURE WEATHER CONDITIONS: The official 6 to 14 day outlook\nindicates colder than seasonal mean temperatures and above\naverage precipitation. Ensemble mean forecast guidance confirms a\ncolder than usual temperature outlook, but suggests only a near\nto below average precipitation profile through March 5th.\n\n.LONG RANGE RIVER MODELING AND PROBABILITY FORECASTS:\nThe ensemble of river forecast system guidance suggests a limited\nchance (10% or less chance) of minor flooding through early March\nat some of the more sensitive headwater basins of the Susquehanna\nand Upper Delaware basins. When comparing current hydrologic\nforecast modeling against historical flows, most basins were\nindicating an average to below average risk of flooding into the\nfirst week of March.\n\n...IN CONCLUSION...\n\nThis outlook estimates the potential for river and lake flooding\nbased on a current overview of hydro-meteorological factors which\ncontribute to flooding.\n\nIt is important to note that significant flooding does not occur\nfrom snow melt alone. Rainfall is the most important factor in\ndetermining the occurrence and severity of flooding in our area.\n\nThe next Winter/Spring Flood Outlook will be issued by this\noffice on March 5th 2020. If conditions change in the interim:\nFlood Watches, Warnings or Advisories will be issued as\nnecessary.",
