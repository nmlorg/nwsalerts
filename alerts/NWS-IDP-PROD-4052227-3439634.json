        "description": "...Additional Moderate to Heavy Rain Expected Across Southeast\nKentucky Tonight Into Tuesday Morning...\n\n.A surface cold front will slide slowly southeast across eastern\nKentucky through Tuesday, producing a few rounds of moderate to\nheavy rainfall across the area. With a saturated ground, any\nadditional rain will convert to mainly runoff and set the stage\nfor the possibility of renewed flooding - especially over the\nCumberland River basin.\n\nThe Flood Watch continues for\n\n* Portions of south central Kentucky and southeast Kentucky,\nincluding the following areas, in south central Kentucky,\nMcCreary and Whitley. In southeast Kentucky, Bell, Harlan, and\nKnox.\n\n* Through Tuesday morning\n\n* Moderate to heavy rainfall remains a concern today through\nTuesday morning, as a slow moving cold front pushes into the\narea. This additional rainfall, on top of saturated soils,\nwill lead to a potential of renewed flooding.\n\n* Minor flooding of low lying areas, as well as rivers, creeks,\nand streams will be possible.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
