        "description": "Gale force winds are expected to impact American Samoa coastal\nwaters as early as Saturday night or Sunday morning. The gale\nforce winds are expected to then continue through Tuesday.\n\nA possible developing tropical cyclone embedded within an active\nmonsoon trough to the northwest of the Samoa Island Chain, is\nanticipated to bring northeast winds of at least 35 knots, with\nhigher gusts, and seas up to 20 feet. Seas and winds are much\nhigher near thunderstorms.\n\nGale force winds and dangerous seas could capsize or damage vessels\nand the frequent showers could reduce visibility.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible hazardous\nconditions. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or\nsecure the vessel for severe wind and seas.\n\nListen to NOAA Weather Radio for the latest updates.\n\nYou may also follow us on Facebook \"NWSPagoPago\" or our website\nat www.weather.gov/ppg.",
