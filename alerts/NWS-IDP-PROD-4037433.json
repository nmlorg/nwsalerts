This will produce moderate to heavy rainfall today through\nThursday. Some locations are expecting to receive between three\nand four inches of rain, with localized heavier amounts possible.\nMuch of the rainfall will come in two separate rounds. The first\nof these will be today and tonight. Soils will likely be able to\nhandle the first round without excessive runoff. However, another\nround of significant rain Wednesday night and Thursday may be\nenough to cause problems with high water on creeks and rivers.\n\nStay tuned for the latest forecast updates over the next few days.",
