Operating a vessel in gale conditions\nrequires experience and properly equipped vessels. It is highly\nrecommended that mariners without the proper experience seek\nsafe harbor prior to the onset of gale conditions.\n\nStrong winds  will cause hazardous seas which could capsize or\ndamage vessels and reduce visibility. Seas will be especially\nsteep and hazardous.",
