        "description": "Significant rises on the rivers and streams in the Grand River\nbasin downstream of Lansing can be expected by early next week.\nHow quickly the rain between Grand Rapids and Lansing changes over\nto freezing rain will determine exactly how high the rivers in\nthis area rise next week. A slower transition to freezing rain\nwill cause the rivers to crest higher, while a faster transition\nwill lower the crest. With many rivers expected to rise to near\nflood stage, now is the time to prepare for significant water\nlevel rises and potential flooding. The Looking Glass River near\nEagle, the Maple River at Maple Rapids, and the Grand River at\nComstock Park and Robinson Township are the most likely locations\nthat could see some minor flooding by early next week.\n\nStay tuned to the latest water and weather forecasts at\nwww.weather.gov/grr\n\n\nAMD",
