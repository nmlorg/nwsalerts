Note that similarly polluted conditions\nwill exist in other portions of the state where population centers\nare located in valleys, such as along the Connecticut river, and\nmountain valleys such as the Barre-Montpelier area.\n\nExposure to elevated levels of fine particles can increase the\nlikelihood of respiratory symptoms in sensitive individuals, and may\naggravate heart or lung disease in persons with cardiopulmonary\ndisease and the elderly.\n\nAn Air Quality Action Day means that particulate concentrations\nwithin the region may approach or exceed unhealthy standards.\n\nFor additional information...please visit the Vermont Agency of\nNatural Resources web site at...\n\nhttp://www.anr.state.vt.us/air/index.htm.",
