Sustained southwest\nwinds continue to slow the flow rate which is leading to elevated\nriver levels. In addition, while no ice blockage has been\nobserved, some ice formation in Lake St Clair may be contributing\nsomewhat to the slower river flow. Locations in and around Algonac\nwill be the most likely places to experience flooding.\n\n* Some locations that may experience flooding include...\nPort Huron, New Baltimore, St. Clair, Algonac, Marysville, Marine\nCity, Harsens Island, Anchorville, Fort Gratiot, Adair, Pearl Beach\nand Fair Haven.",
