Heavy freezing spray at a rate of\n2 cm per hour or greater expected, and may rapidly accumulate\non vessels.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of Western Lake Superior.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, from 3 PM EST /2 PM CST/ this\nafternoon to 1 AM EST /midnight CST/ Thursday. For the Heavy\nFreezing Spray Warning, from 1 PM EST /noon CST/ Wednesday to\n1 PM EST /noon CST/ Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",

If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
