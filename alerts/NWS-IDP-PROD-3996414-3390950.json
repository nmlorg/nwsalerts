Strong\nnorth to northeast winds gusting up to 40 to 50 mph will build\nwaves to 12 to 18 feet with occasional waves up to 23 feet.\n\n* WHERE...The shoreline areas of Cook and Lake Counties in\nIllinois and Lake County in Indiana, with slightly less wave\nheights in Porter County Indiana.\n\n* WHEN...Overnight through Saturday night.\n\n* IMPACTS...The winds and large battering waves combined with near\nrecord high lake levels could exacerbate already significant\nbeach and shoreline erosion sustained in the past several\nmonths. Vulnerable structures along the shore may be heavily\ndamaged. In addition, flood prone paths and roads along the lake\nwill be susceptible to lengthy closures due to the expected long\nduration of high winds and waves. Heed any closures and stay\naway from the edge of the lake.",
