This will bring much lighter precipitation, generally\n1 to 3 inches in the mountains and a quarter to a half an inch for\nthe lowlands. Snow levels will be lowering to near 2000 feet with\nthis storm so there will be little impact on the rivers.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Snoqualmie River Near Snoqualmie Falls\n* Until late tonight.\n* At  8:45 AM Friday the flow was 27727 cfs.\n* Flood flow is 20000 cfs.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...The river will continue to rise and crest near 29403 cfs\naround 10 AM Friday. The river will fall below flood flow this\nevening.\n* Impact...At 20000 cfs, the Snoqualmie River will cause widespread\nflooding of pasture lands and roads along the river from the town\nof Snoqualmie downstream through Fall City. Roads that may become\nflooded include Fall City-Carnation...Tolt Hill...and Novelty Flats\nRoads. This river level on the Snoqualmie corresponds roughly to a\nphase 3 flood in the King County flood system.",
