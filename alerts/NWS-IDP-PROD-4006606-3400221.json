This is a result of\nup to about 4 inches of rain that fell between late Thursday and late\nSaturday, heaviest in western Indiana near and south of Interstate\n74.\n\nThe large majority of the Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers\nare either in flood or expected to flood, with some locations\nreaching moderate flood stage.  Crests are expected to be the highest\nsince either February or June of 2019.\n\nAs of late Sunday evening, the Wabash River was rising along\nthe entire length of the river.  The crest is expected to reach\nLafayette by Monday afternoon.  Montezuma will crest this Sunday\nnight.  A broad crest on the White River is from Noblesville to\nCenterton.  The crest on the East Fork White River is in the Columbus\nand Seymour areas.  Flooding on the Wabash and and White Rivers will\nlast into at least late next week. Flooding on the East Fork White\nRiver will last until probably late Monday or early Tuesday next\nweek.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday, thus\narea waterways will be able to continue their downward trend.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River at Williams.\n* until Tuesday January 21.\n* At  7:00 AM Sunday the stage was 7.9 feet.\n* Flood stage is 8.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...Rise above flood stage by this afternoon and continue to\nrise to near 13.1 feet by Thursday evening.

The summer flood crest of 13.2 feet came 3\nweeks later in the summer season than the June 28, 1960 crest of\n15.1 feet and is believed to be the latest for the summer season\nsince at least the late 1940s.",
