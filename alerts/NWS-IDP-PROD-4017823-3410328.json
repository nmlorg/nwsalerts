        "description": "...Winter Storm Continues into Saturday...\n\n.Snow has transitioned to a wintry mix of freezing rain and sleet\nacross much of eastern Iowa and west central Illinois. This\ntransition will continue to move across northwest Illinois the\nrest of the evening. Overnight, the freezing rain and sleet may\ntaper off to freezing drizzle. Total snow and sleet accumulations\nof 2 to 6 inches are likely, along with ice accumulations up to\ntwo tenths of an inch. Strong southeast winds gusting up to 30 to\n35 MPH through this evening when combined with the falling\nprecipitation will further reduce visibilities and cause\ndangerous traveling conditions. By Saturday morning, very strong\nnorthwest winds gusting to 40 to 45 MPH will lead to blowing and\ndrifting snow with greatly reduced visibility. These winds will\ncombine with falling temperatures to produce wind chills down to\n10 below zero to 20 below zero during the evening hours Saturday.\n\n* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Additional snow and sleet\naccumulations of up to 2 inches. Total accumulations of 3 to 5\ninches and ice accumulations of up to one tenth of an inch.\nNorthwest winds gusting around 40 mph on Saturday.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of north central and northwest Illinois.\n\n* WHEN...From noon Friday to 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing snow\ncould significantly reduce visibilities on Saturday.",
