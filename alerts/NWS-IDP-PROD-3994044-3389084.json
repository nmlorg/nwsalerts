Expect dangerous travel conditions, near zero\nvisibilities at times with snow and ice covered roads.\n\nHAZARD...Snow and blowing snow. Wind gusts greater than 35 mph.\n\nSOURCE...Radar indicated.\n\nIMPACT...Dangerous life-threatening travel.\n\nThis includes the following highways...\nInterstate 95 between mile markers 1 and 26.\nInterstate 95 in New Hampshire between mile markers 8 and 16.\n\nThis also includes...\nYork Beach, Ogunquit Beach, and Wells Beach.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nRochester, Portsmouth, Durham, Kittery, Alfred, Sanford, Northwood,\nDover, Somersworth, Kennebunk, Barrington, Berwick, Farmington,\nEpping, Lebanon, Barnstead, Epsom, Greenland, Kennebunkport and South\nBerwick.",
        "instruction": "Travel is not advised during this dangerous snow squall.  Rapid\nvisibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to lead to\naccidents.  Consider delaying travel until the squall passes your\nlocation.  If traveling, pull off to a safe location and turn your\nheadlights on.\n\nTemperatures are above freezing, but sharply colder temperatures\nfollowing the snow will cause any water or slush to quickly freeze on\nroads and sidewalks.  Untreated road surfaces will become extremely\nslippery.  Reduced speeds and increased distance between vechicles is\nadvised.",
