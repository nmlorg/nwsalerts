Overflowing poor drainage\nareas will result in additional minor flooding. Up to one inch of\nrain has already fallen.\n\nSome locations that will experience flooding include...\nEl Centro, Calexico, Imperial, Plaster City, Ocotillo, Mt. Signal, El\nCentro Naval Airfield, Heber, Coyote Wells, Dixieland and Seeley.",
        "instruction": "Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of small\ncreeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses as\nwell as other drainage areas and low lying spots.\n\nIn hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are\npotentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded\nroads. Find an alternate route.\n\nA Flood Advisory means river or stream flows are elevated, or ponding\nof water in urban or other areas is occurring or is imminent.",
