Heavily drifting snow will\nhamper snow clearing efforts until about 500 PM MST, after which\nthe wind speed should subside. Light snow will return during the\nlate night hours tonight.\n\n* WHAT...Wind gusts of 25 to 35 mph will produce areas of blowing\nand drifting snow.\n\n* WHERE...The highlands of south central Idaho extending east to\nBear Lake, including Interstate 15 and Interstate 84.\n\n* WHEN...Continuing through 5 PM MST today.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing\nsnow could significantly reduce visibility, as well as\ntemporary road closures due to drifting.",
