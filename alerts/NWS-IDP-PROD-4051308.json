Clear skies and plunging\ntemperatures were also resulting in patches of dense fog across\ncentral and north-central Wisconsin. The fog will persist through\nmid-morning. Where the fog is present, frost may deposit on\npreviously treated roads, causing them to become slippery again.\n\nBe sure to allow for some extra some extra time to remove snow or\nfrost from your vehicle before heading out on the roads this\nmorning. Be prepared for slippery roads, and use extra caution.",
