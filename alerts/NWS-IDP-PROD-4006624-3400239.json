Vehicle access is not currently\npossible past Amiyung Drive on Eddy Lane.\n\n* This is a hazardous situation, persons not required to be in the\narea should avoid it.  A shallow covering of ice may conceal deep\nflowing water.  Use extreme caution, including proper footwear and\ntraction, if you have to be in the area.\n\n* Please do not drive vehicles in this area for both safety and to\nprevent road damage.\n\n* Water levels have fallen slightly since the initial ice jam last\nSunday, but are expected to remain fairly constant while the ice\njam is in place.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nthe Big Eddy area of Soldotna.",
