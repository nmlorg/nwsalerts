        "description": "A brief warming trend across the West Coast and Interior will\ncome to an abrupt end beginning late Sunday.\n\nLow pressure will move north along the coast through the day\nSaturday and weaken over the Chukchi Sea early Sunday. As the low\npasses, winds will turn westerly, bringing an influx of cold air\nback to the region.\n\nHigh pressure will strengthen across the region, further cooling\ntemperatures into next week. Widespread 20s to 30s below can be\nexpected along the coast by late Monday. 30s to 40s below can be\nexpected in the Western Interior.\n\nModels show a considerable spread in temperatures later in the\nweek, so there is fairly low confidence in the long term forecast.\nFor now we expect cold temperatures to linger throughout the\nweek.\n\nResidents should prepare for cold temperatures, especially if\ntraveling, by keeping cold weather gear available at all times.\n\nFor the latest forecasts go to www.weather.gov/afg",
