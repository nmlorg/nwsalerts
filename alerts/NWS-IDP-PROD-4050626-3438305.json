        "description": "...HIGH SURF WARNING FOR NORTH AND WEST FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU\nKAUAI OAHU MOLOKAI AND NORTH FACING SHORES OF MAUI...\n\n.The combination of a long-period northwest swell and a low\npressure system passing through the state will bring large and\ndisorganized surf tonight through Monday night. This could cause\nsignificant beach erosion, overwash onto vulnerable low-lying\ncoastal roadways, and surges within north and west facing harbors\nsuch as Haleiwa and Waianae harbors.\n\n* WHAT...Surf building to 14 to 20 feet tonight and 18 to 28 feet\nMonday along north and west facing shores of Niihau and Kauai,\nand north facing shores of Oahu, Molokai, and Maui. Surf\nbuilding to 8 to 12 feet tonight and 12 to 20 feet along west\nfacing shores of Oahu and Molokai.\n\n* WHERE...North and west facing shores of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu,\nMolokai, and north facing shores of Maui.\n\n* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 6 AM HST Tuesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...High. Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping\nacross portions of beaches, very strong breaking waves, and\nstrong longshore and rip currents. Breaking waves may\noccasionally impact harbors making navigating the harbor\nchannel dangerous.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of strong onshore winds,\nlarge surf, and peak monthly tides could cause significant beach\nerosion, flooding of beaches that normally remain dry and\noverwash onto vulnerable low-lying coastal roads and other\ncoastal infrastructure.",
