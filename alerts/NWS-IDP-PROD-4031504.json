        "description": "A mix of rain and snow is expected to develop late this afternoon\nand persist into the evening. The snow should be mainly along and\nnorth of a line from Van Buren and Cape Girardeau, Missouri to\nMarion, Kentucky. Areas from Poplar Bluff to Paducah and\nHopkinsville should see mainly rain. However a brief wintry mix\ncannot be ruled out.\n\nSince temperatures will be mainly above freezing at the ground,\nany snow accumulations will be mainly on grassy areas. Up to one\nhalf inch is possible along the Route 13 corridor of southern\nIllinois, westward into southeast Missouri including the\nPerryville and Marble Hill areas.\n\nSome slick spots cannot be ruled out on area roads into this\nevening, primarily on bridges, overpasses, and secondary roads.\nUse extra caution as you travel in the affected areas.",
