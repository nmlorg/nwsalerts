Any additional snow\naccumulation will be an inch of less across eastern Minnesota and\nwest central Wisconsin.\n\nIncreasing northwest winds will cause blowing snow, with\nsignificant reductions in visibility expected to occur over\nwestern Minnesota. Wind gusts to 50 mph are possible with\nvisibility possible near zero a times. The worst conditions will\noccur in west central into south central Minnesota through the\nday. The Blizzard Warning continues for west central into a\nportion of south central Minnesota today. In addition, falling\ntemperatures will lead to icy roads and dangerously cold wind\nchills this afternoon.\n\n* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning, additional snow\naccumulations of up to one inch. Winds gusting as high as 40\nmph. For the Blizzard Warning, blizzard conditions expected.\nTotal snow accumulations of up to one inch.
