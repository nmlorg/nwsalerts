        "description": "...Period of Light Freezing Rain Friday Morning...\n\n.Low pressure tracking across the Ohio Valley into the Great\nLakes will spread rain across the Mid Atlantic region beginning\nlate tonight or early Friday, continuing into Friday night.

Most ice\naccumulations are only expected to amount to a trace, with perhaps\na few hundredths of an inch of ice in the Greenbrier and\nShenandoah Valleys. With temperatures hovering near 32F, ice\naccumulations are expected to primarily be confined to elevated\nobjects such as trees, power lines, and decks, as well as some\nuntreated bridges and overpasses.\n\n* WHAT...Freezing rain, briefly mixed with sleet and snow early,\nchanging to rain by midday. Only trace amounts of snow and ice\nexpected. Ice accumulations of 0.01 to 0.05 inch.\nWinds gusting as high as 45 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of southwest and west central Virginia as well\nas southeast West Virginia.\n\n* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 1 PM EST Friday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Some bridges, overpasses, and mainly secondary\nuntreated roads could become slippery and hazardous early Friday\nmorning. The hazardous conditions could impact the morning\ncommute.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Untreated roads and sidewalks will be\nslick. Use caution and plan on extra time to reach your\ndestination in the morning.",
