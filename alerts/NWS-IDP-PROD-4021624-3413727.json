Heavy freezing spray at a rate of\n2 cm per hour or greater possible, and may rapidly accumulate\non vessels.\n\n* WHERE...Lake Superior from Saxon Harbor WI to Upper Entrance\nto Portage Canal MI 5NM off shore to the US/Canadian border\nincluding Isle Royale National Park.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Watch, from late tonight through Tuesday\nafternoon. For the Heavy Freezing Spray Watch, from this\nevening through Tuesday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of stability.\nStrong winds can cause hazardous waves which could capsize or\ndamage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should consider altering plans to avoid or mitigate\nhazardous accumulation of ice on their vessel.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible\nhazardous conditions.  Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter\ncourse, and/or secure the vessel for severe wind and waves.",
