Seas\nwill build to 4 to 8 feet by late Monday.\n\n* WHERE...Gulf waters beyond 5 fathoms including the Dry\nTortugas.\n\n* WHEN...In Effect.\n\n* IMPACTS...A Small Craft Advisory means that wind speeds of 20\nto 33 knots, or seas of 7 feet or greater, are expected to\nproduce hazardous conditions for small craft. These hazardous\nconditions may result in poor vessel handling and steering\nresponse, broaching, overturned dinghies and kayaks, slips and\nfalls on slippery decks, rub damage along docks and seawalls,\nswamped bows at reef tract mooring balls, and dragging anchors.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The wind increase will occur suddenly due\nto passage of a strong cold front.",
