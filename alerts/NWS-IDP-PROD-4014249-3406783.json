Most of the snow will fall late Friday morning into\nFriday evening. Currently, 5 to 9 inches of snow is expected\nacross much of central and southern Minnesota and western\nWisconsin.\n\nSnow will taper off Friday night, but on Saturday northwest winds\nwill increase and lead to significant blowing and drifting snow.\nIn addition, falling temperatures will lead to icy roads. Farther\nwest, blizzard conditions are possible in open areas of western\ninto southern Minnesota. If the forecast winds of 40 to 45 mph\nremain on track, an upgrade to a blizzard warning is likely for\nSaturday across western and southern Minnesota.\n\nThis storm will impact travel. Moderate to heavy snow will lead to\nsnow-covered roads on Friday. Strong winds and falling\ntemperatures will lead to blowing snow and drifting on Saturday.\n\n* WHAT...Snow accumulations of 4 to 7 inches on Friday. Northwest\nwinds gusting as high as 45 mph with blizzard conditions\npossible on Saturday.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of central, south central, southwest and west\ncentral Minnesota.\n\n* WHEN...From 8 AM Friday to 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing snow\ncould significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions\ncould impact the morning or evening commute.",
