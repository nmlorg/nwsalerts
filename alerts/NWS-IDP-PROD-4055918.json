        "description": "At 129 pm, the combination of a moist airmass lingering over the\nrelative cool Bay and Gulf waters will continue to produce areas\nof marine fog this afternoon across the coastal portions of\nCameron County. Visibilities between 1 and 3 miles can be expected\nwhich will pose difficult navigation for unexperienced mariners\nand pilots. These areas of marine fog will mainly affect the far\nsouthern portions of the Laguna Madre and the marine locations out\nto 20 nautical miles offshore of Cameron County.\n\nMariners should be especially cautious when piloting around the\nQueen Isabella Causeway.\n\nIf you must navigate, proceed with caution. Use proper fog signals.\nMake sure all running lights are on. Remember to use your radar\nand compass.\n\nStay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio or your local media for further\nupdates.",
