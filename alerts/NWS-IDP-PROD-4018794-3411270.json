Near whiteout\nconditions are possible in open and rural areas. Additional\nsnowfall through midday will range from a dusting to around an\ninch for most locations. For tonight, strong winds and very cold\ntemperatures will create wind chills of 15 to 25 below zero, with\nnear 30 below zero values possible in the far northwest forecast\narea.\n\n* WHAT...Additional snow accumulations of a dusting. Northwest\nwinds gusting up to 50 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of northeast Missouri, southeast Iowa and\nwest central Illinois.\n\n* WHEN...Now through 6 PM CST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Difficult travel due to snow covered or icy roads.\nBlowing snow and significant reductions in visibilities are\npossible, mainly in open and rural areas.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...For locations that received ice\naccumulation and it has not melted off elevated objects, the\nheavy weight of the ice combined with strong winds could bring\ndown tree branches and lead to isolated power outages.",
