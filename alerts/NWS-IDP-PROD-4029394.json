        "description": "A winter storm system will traverse the state today, bringing\nlight to moderate snow accumulations to western and northern New\nMexico this afternoon. Snow totals will reach up to 4 to 6 inches\natop the Sangre de Cristo Mountains down to Raton Pass. This will\nallow for some slick roads and difficult travel conditions through\nmountain passes and on I-25 at Raton Pass this afternoon.\nVisibility reductions may also be possible through any passing\nshowers.\n\nMeanwhile, strong northwest winds with gusts reaching upwards of\n45 to 50 mph will reach the western terrain along the continental\ndivide and east slopes of the south-central mountains this\nafternoon. A backdoor front will then surge southward through the\neastern plains along the Texas border late this evening through\nmidnight bringing gusts upwards of 45 mph. This will cause\nhazardous crosswinds for those traveling on east to west oriented\nhighways.\n\nAnyone planning travel through northern and central New Mexico\ntoday and tonight should be prepared to encounter adverse weather\nconditions. Monitor NOAA weather radio, weather.gov/abq or your\nlocal media for the latest weather updates. For the latest New\nMexico road conditions visit nmroads.com or call 5-1-1.",
