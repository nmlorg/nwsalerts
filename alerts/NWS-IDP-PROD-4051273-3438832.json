In\nTexas, Angelina, Cherokee, Gregg, Harrison, Marion,\nNacogdoches, Panola, Rusk, Sabine, San Augustine, and Shelby.\n\n* Through Wednesday afternoon\n\n* A cold front will slowly shift southeast into East Texas,\nSouth-Central Arkansas, and North Louisiana today and tonight,\nbefore drifting south of the area by early Tuesday morning.\nAmple moisture and upper level disturbances will interact with\nthe front and result in showers and embedded thunderstorms\ncontaining locally heavy rainfall to develop and move over these\nareas.\n\n* Widespread rainfall amounts of three to in excess of six\ninches, with isolated higher amounts, are expected across the\nwatch area through Wednesday afternoon. Given the already\nsaturated grounds due to above normal rainfall observed since\nJanuary, this additional rainfall will quickly runoff,\nresulting in an increased flash flood threat.",
