        "description": "Melting snow has already created some substantial rises in streams\nwest of the Missouri River. Flood warnings are already in place for\nminor flooding along the Cannonball River at Breien and the Missouri\nRiver west of Williston. As much above normal temperatures are\nexpected to persist through the week, other rivers and streams such\nas the Knife, Little Missouri, Heart, Apple Creek and Beaver Creek\nnear Linton are likely to receive sufficient runoff to raise water\nlevels and lift the ice off the shoreline. While most of this area\ndoes not have enough water in the snowpack to produce widespread\nsignificant flooding, the risk of icejam related high water will be\nat its peak this week in these waterways if enough flow can be\ngenerated to mobilize the ice cover.\n\nIn the northwest quarter of the state, the Yellowstone river near\nMontana is also expected to see its water levels continue to rise\nand a correspondingly higher risk of its ice cover breaking up.\n\nEast of Bismarck, the snowpack will prove to be a little more\nresilient, but runoff should be in full swing by late in the work\nweek. In particular, the Prairie Pothole areas will see small\nwetlands and lakes begin to rise towards the end of the week, and\nthis will threaten some low-lying roads with inundation and\nclosures. Also, ice anglers should be wary of rapidly deteriorating\nshorelines from which they access local fisheries. The James River\nand Pipestem creek watersheds should also be prepared for runoff\nstarting to cause rising water levels by week's end even though that\narea should have the most resilient of snowcover.\n\nLastly, the Souris River Basin should also experience melting\nconditions, but the majority of the contributing area north and west\nof Minot has very little snow cover. Little risk of flooding is\nexpected along the Souris upstream of Minot. While enough snow is\nfound over in the Towner, Willow City and Westhope region to create\na fair amount of runoff, that may not occur this week.",
