        "description": "* WHAT...Northwest winds 20 to 30 kt with gusts up to 40 kt and\nwaves 8 to 13 feet expected. Heavy freezing spray at a rate of\n2 cm per hour or greater expected, and may rapidly accumulate\non vessels.\n\n* WHERE...Lake Superior from Grand Marais MI to Whitefish Point\nMI 5NM off shore to the US/Canadian border, Lake Superior East\nof a line from Manitou Island to Marquette MI and West of a\nline from Grand Marais MI to the US/Canadian Border Beyond 5NM\nfrom shore and Lake Superior West of Line from Manitou Island\nto Marquette MI Beyond 5NM from shore.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, from 11 AM Tuesday to 9 AM EST\nWednesday. For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 7 PM\nTuesday to 10 AM EST Wednesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
