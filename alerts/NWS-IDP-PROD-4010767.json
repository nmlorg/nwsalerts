        "description": "A couple disturbances Thursday and Friday will bring widespread\nprecipitation to the area, including mountain snow to western and\nnorthern NM and rain with the potential for freezing rain across\nportions of the eastern plains. A backdoor cold front moving\nthrough the eastern plains on Wednesday will cool surface\ntemperatures and help set the stage for a wintry mix. Portions of\nthe eastern plains, particularly the I-40 corridor from Santa\nRosa to Tucumcari as well as areas north to Clayton and south to\nClovis will have the greatest potential of seeing areas of\nfreezing rain Thursday morning and then again late Thursday night.\nTotal ice accumulations ranging from 0.01\" to 0.10\" are possible\nwhich may cause slick and hazardous travel conditions.\n\nHeavy mountain snow will also be possible across the northern\nmountains beginning Thursday afternoon and continuing through\nFriday. Several inches of snow will be possible above 7500 feet\nwith snow accumulations over a foot possible in the peaks of the\nTusas and Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Strong westerly winds on\nFriday will lead to areas of blowing snow across northern NM. Very\nslick roads may lead to hazardous travel conditions along the\nContinental Divide of Interstate 40 and U.S. 550 as well as\nthrough mountainous terrain of northern NM.\n\nHigh confidence exists in mountain snow accumulations, but lesser\nconfidence remains regarding freezing rain across the east. Monitor\nNOAA weather radio, weather.gov/abq or your local media for the\nlatest weather updates. For the latest New Mexico road conditions\nvisit nmroads.com or call 5-1-1.",
