For the\nFreezing Spray Advisory, light accumulation of freezing spray\nexpected.\n\n* WHERE...Coastal waters from Merrimack River, MA to Stonington,\nME out to 25 NM, including Casco and Penobscot Bays.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, from noon today to noon EST\nFriday. For the Freezing Spray Advisory, from 2 AM to 5 PM EST\nFriday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Strong winds will cause hazardous seas which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility. Operating a\nvessel in freezing spray is hazardous. Freezing spray may render\nmechanical and electronic components inoperative. Ice accretion\non decks and superstructures may result in some loss of\nstability.",
        "instruction": "A Gale Warning means winds of 34 to 47 knots are imminent or\noccuring. Operating a vessel in gale conditions requires\nexperience and properly equipped vessels. It is highly recommended\nthat mariners without the proper experience seek safe harbor prior\nto the onset of gale conditions.\n\nMariners should prepare for accumulation of ice on their vessel\nand consider altering plans to avoid or mitigate these hazardous\nnavigating conditions.",
