        "description": "A cold air mass will spread over the area Sunday night behind a\ncold front. Overnight low temperatures will fall to levels well\nbelow normal for this time of year. Temperatures in the teens to\nlow 20s will be common across the interior valleys and in the\nsingle digits to teens for the mountains, especially Monday night\nwhen the winds associated with the cold front are weaker. There is\na chance that some higher mountain valley locations could see\ntemperatures drop to around zero late Monday night and Tuesday\nmorning.\n\nTemperatures this cold could burst exposed pipes outdoors or pipes\nin poorly insulated structures, and cause a threat to life for\npeople, pets, or livestock outdoors for an extended period of\ntime. Residents living across the interior portions of the area\nare advised to take action to protect their property in advance of\nthis cold air mass settling into the region Sunday night. Plan any\noutdoor work being performed during the overnight or early morning\nhours for the warmer parts of the day Sunday through Tuesday.",
