In\nSoutheast Missouri, Dunklin and Pemiscot.\n\n* From this evening through Saturday morning\n\n* Over 2 inches of rain is possible through Saturday morning\n\n* Thunderstorms will become widespread as a storm system arrives\nfrom the southern Plains Friday Night. Initially, storms may sit\nfor several hours Northeast Arkansas and the Missouri Bootheel\nFriday evening before finally pushing east. Torrential downpours\nwill possible with the storms. Since vegetation is dormant, and\nnot consuming much ground water, runoff from heavy rain will be\nincreased. This elevates the concern for flash flooding. Also,\nrapid rises may occur on creeks, small streams, and flashy\nrivers. Flooding of low-lying and poorly drained areas, as well\nas low water crossings, can be expected.",
