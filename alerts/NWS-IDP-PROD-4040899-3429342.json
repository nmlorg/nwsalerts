        "description": "...Heavy rain will bring a good chance of flooding...\n\n.A powerful low pressure system will move through the Carolinas\nand southern middle Atlantic through tonight. Bands of heavy\nshowers passing repeatedly over the same areas will increase the\nrisk for flooding through early tonight, especially over the\nPiedmont.\n\nThe Flood Watch continues for\n\n* A portion of central North Carolina, including the following\nareas, Alamance, Anson, Chatham, Davidson, Durham, Forsyth,\nFranklin, Granville, Guilford, Lee, Montgomery, Moore, Orange,\nPerson, Randolph, Richmond, Stanly, Vance, Wake, and Warren.\n\n* Through late early tonight\n\n* A powerful storm system will bring periods of heavy downpours\nthrough early tonight, especially over the Piedmont. Storm total\nrainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in this area, with the\nhighest totals likely to be in the Triad region.\n\n* Rapid rises on creeks are likely, along with flooding in low\nlying and poor drainage areas. Flooding is also expected on\nsome main stem rivers in the Piedmont. Wet pavement and\nconsiderable ponding of water on roads will raise the risk of\nhydroplaning.",
