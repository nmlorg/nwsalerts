Heavily drifting snow will\nhamper snow clearing efforts until about 500 PM MST, after which\nthe wind speed should subside. Light snow will return during the\nlate night hours tonight.\n\n* WHAT...Wind gusts of 20 to 30 mph will produce areas of blowing\nand drifting snow.\n\n* WHERE...The highlands of the Idaho-Wyoming border region, from\nMacks Inn at the Montana border to the Bear River range along\nthe Utah border.\n\n* WHEN...Continues through 5 PM MST today.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel will be difficult at times, especially\noutside of well-maintained travel corridors. Blowing snow\ncould significantly reduce visibility and possibly cause road\nclosures.",
