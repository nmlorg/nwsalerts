For the Gale Warning, northwest\nwinds 20 to 25 kt with gusts up to 30 kt and waves 6 to 8 feet\noccurring. For the Small Craft Advisory, northwest winds 10 to\n20 kt with gusts up to 30 kt and waves 5 to 8 feet expected.\n\n* WHERE...Saxon Harbor WI to Black River MI, Black River to\nOntonagon MI and Ontonagon to Upper Entrance of Portage Canal\nMI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, until 10 AM EST\n/9 AM CST/ Wednesday. For the Gale Warning, until 1 AM EST\n/midnight CST/ Wednesday. For the Small Craft Advisory, from 1\nAM EST /midnight CST/ to 1 PM EST /noon CST/ Wednesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of stability.\nStrong winds will cause hazardous waves which could capsize or\ndamage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
