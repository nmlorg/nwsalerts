        "description": "A developing winter storm system approaching from the mid-\nMississippi Valley will bring the potential for moderate to\npossibly heavy snow mainly for central and eastern Upper Michigan\nSaturday night into early Sunday. The expected snow with this\nsystem should be much lighter and fluffier than the dense, high\nwater content snow we have experienced with previous storm systems\nthis season. This fluffier snow should make removal somewhat\neasier behind the storm and lessen potential impacts on trees and\npower lines.\n\nAccompanying the potential snow will also be gusty northeast\nwinds. These strong northeast winds will have the potential to\ngust as high as 35 to 40 mph near the Lake Superior shoreline and\nalong the Bay of Green Bay in southern Menominee County. These\nstronger winds may cause considerable blowing and drifting snow\nand sharply reduced visibility at times.\n\nThe strong northeast winds could also cause minor lakeshore\nflooding and beach erosion late Saturday into early Sunday for\nlocations along Lake Superior from Marquette through Keweenaw Bay,\nand also along the Bay of Green Bay from Cedar River to Menominee.\n\nThose planning travel or recreational activities in Upper Michigan\nlater this weekend, need to stay tuned to the latest forecasts\nand updated statements on this potential winter storm.",
