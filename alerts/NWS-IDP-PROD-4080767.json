        "description": "A series of storm systems will traverse the Tennessee Valley for\nthe first half of the upcoming work week, bringing widespread\nrainfall amounts of 4 to 5 inches for portions of the area. Given\nour wet start to 2020, this will pose a significant flooding\nthreat because soils are so saturated, even with the drier weather\nin the past few days. Though rain is in the forecast beginning\nSunday night, rain chances will linger through Thursday, the most\nsignificant rainfall amounts will occur Wednesday and Thursday.\nThere continues to be some uncertainty with the timeframe as\nmodels come into better timing agreements, so further adjustments\nare likely warranted in the next day or two. Some flash flooding\nis likely, though the overall threat will continue to be river\nflooding and any associated impacts from that (flooded roadways,\netc.).\n\nRainfall during the month of January was above normal for the\nentire forecast area in Northern Alabama and Southern Middle TN,\nwith the highest rainfall occurring along and west of Interstate\n65. In these locations, rainfall was between 3 and 5 inches above\nnormal, with several spots ranging between 5 and 8 inches above\nnormal for the month. February was no different, as we saw last\nyear. Above normal rainfall continued, and even increased for\nFebruary 2020, with many locations tallying between 5 and 8\ninches above normal once again. As of today, numerous sites across\nthe forecast area have measured well over a foot of rainfall for\nthe month, with several sites approaching 15+ inches for February\n2020.\n\nIf the forecast verifies this week with the rainfall expected\n(4-5\", with isolated higher amounts), widespread river flooding\nwill occur. Initially, smaller creeks and streams will become\noverwhelmed and overflow their banks, eventually flowing into\nlarger creek and river tributaries of the Tennessee River by\nmidweek. This would include the Flint River, Paint Rock River, Elk\nRiver, and Big Nance Creek in Northern Alabama and Southern Middle\nTennessee. Then, those floodwaters will flow into the Tennessee\nRiver, and we'll have lingering effects from that through the\nupcoming weekend, most likely. In addition to any rainfall that\noccurs this upcoming week, the Tennessee Valley Authority is\nalready spilling water downstream to essentially \"make room\" for\nthe expected rainfall totals next week, and they will do their\nbest to manage the potential flooding situation along the\nmainstem of the Tennessee River as possible.\n\nPlease stay tuned for further forecast updates over the coming\ndays. The rainfall forecast will continue to be updated and\nadjusted as model guidance comes into better agreement over the\nnext 24-48 hours. Have a plan in place now! Know what to do when\nand if a Flood Warning is issued for your location! Move to higher\nground immediately, and remember, when traveling, TURN AROUND,\nDON'T DROWN! Finding alternate routes to a flooded roadway may\nsave your life!",
