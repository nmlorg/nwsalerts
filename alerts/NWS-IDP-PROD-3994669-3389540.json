        "description": "...Parade of Winter Storms to Pummel the Mountains and Highlands of\nCentral and Eastern Idaho...\n\n.By late Friday night, a series of winter storms that will be\nmoving through the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest will\nfinally push eastward enough to start affecting central and\neastern Idaho. The first storm is the strongest, bringing not only\ngusty wind by Saturday, but also 6 to 14 inches of snow to\nportions of the central Idaho mountains, mainly the Stanley Basin\nand Sawtooth Mountains, and the entire Wood River Basin. And\nbefore Saturday sunrise, the eastern highlands from the Macks Inn\nand Island Park region at the Montana border southward to the Bear\nRiver Range on the Utah border will also experience heavy snow,\nwith widespread 6 to 12 inches of new snow. However, this is just\nthe first in a parade of winter storms. More snow arrives on\nSunday and Sunday night, then at least one more heavy snowstorm on\nMonday, with another possible on Tuesday. If this impressive\nseries of storms stay as forecast, snow removal resources and\noperations will be pushed to their limits for a consistent four-\nday period. The Idaho transportation system at the state, county\nand municipal level will undergo severe impacts, especially during\nthe upcoming weekend.\n\nThe Snake River plain, eastern Magic Valley, Lost River and\nPahsimeroi basins, and the south central highlands of Idaho will\nnot be able to dodge this series of storms either. 1 to 7 inches,\ndepending on location, are expected for Saturday and Saturday\nnight, then 1 to 5 inches on Sunday and more on Monday.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 9\ninches every 24 hours for three days, except 5 to 14 inches\nevery 24 hours on ridge tops and passes possible for as many as\nthree days. Winds will likely gust as high as 35 mph.\n\n* WHERE...The Sawtooth Mountains and Stanley basin, the Wood River\nbasin and surrounding mountains, and the eastern highlands from\nMacks Inn and Island Park southward to the Bear River Range on\nthe Utah border.\n\n* WHEN...From Friday evening through Tuesday afternoon.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Travel could be very difficult to\nimpossible both at airfields and on highways, roads, and\nstreets. Winds will drift snow shortly after efforts to clear\nroads have occurred.",
