        "description": "* Unusually pronounced high pressure will build into the region\nthrough today, bringing above normal temperatures and mostly\nsunny skies. Temperatures today could approach record highs. No\ndoubt a great time for outdoor recreation or even yard work\nyou've been putting off.\n\n* On Sunday a strong cold front will push quickly through the\nregion, bringing strong winds and snow. Widespread strong\nsouthwest winds Sunday morning will shift to the northwest\nbehind the front Sunday afternoon/evening. This will bring\nimpacts for high profile vehicles and rough air for aviation.\nAlong highways 395 and 95, especially south of I-80, plan for\nstrong crosswinds and areas of blowing dust. This includes\nWalker Lake and Mono County, where very dry air along with\nstrong winds may also create localized critical fire weather\nconditions.\n\n* A brief period of higher intensity snow is also likely during\nthe day Sunday, which may cause travel impacts on roadways\nincluding across Sierra passes. Road impacts in Western Nevada\ncities remains more uncertain due to warm ground temperatures.\nHowever, don't be surprised if there are slick roads coming home\nfrom Sunday afternoon gatherings. Icy spots on roadways could\nlinger into Monday morning.\n\n* Monday and Tuesday will be cold, certainly compared to what\nwe've seen recently. Temperatures Monday will be about 30\ndegrees colder versus highs this afternoon. Brisk north winds\nwill remind us all that it is still winter. Snow showers are\npossible in this cold airmass, including lake effect snow\nsqualls south of Pyramid, Tahoe, and Walker Lakes. This could\naffect travel on I-80 between Reno and Fernley during the Monday\nmorning commute.",
