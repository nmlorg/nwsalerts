        "description": "The arctic cold front will front will move across the area by 930\npm, bringing a round of light to moderate snow. Visibilities may\ndrop down to around a half of mile for a period of time. Most\nlocations should see an inch or two of snow before tapering off\nto scattered flurries early Thursday morning. The combination of\nthe falling snow, along with melting snow on pavement surfaces and\nfalling air temperatures well below freezing could lead to a\nflash freeze this evening. Gusty northerly winds may also create\nsome areas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nOvernight, temperatures are expected to fall to 5 below to 5 above\nzero. The combination of the cold temperatures and gusty northerly\nwinds will produce wind chill readings in the 10 below to 20\nbelow zero range late tonight into Thursday morning. Wind chill\nreadings this low can produce frost bite in 30 minutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving tonight as roads\nwill be slippery due to ice and snow. If venturing outdoors\novernight, wear layers of clothing along with a hat and gloves\nto protect yourself from the cold.",
