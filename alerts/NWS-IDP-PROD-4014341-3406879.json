Additional showers and possibly a thunderstorm are\nexpected through this afternoon. This will cause minor flooding in\nthe advisory area. Radar and precipitation gauges show between 1\nand 3 inches of rain have already fallen over northern Medina,\neastern Bandera and southern Kerr and Kendall counties.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nMedina, Kerrville, Comfort, Bandera, Ingram, Lakehills, Camp Verde,\nCliff, Bandera Falls, New Fountain, Old Tunnel State Park,\nKerrville-Schreiner Park, Quihi, Mico, Bankersmith, Cypress Creek,\nPipe Creek, Center Point, Kronkosky State Natural Area and Hill\nCountry State Natural Area.\n\nAdditional rainfall of 1 to 2 inches is expected over the area. This\nadditional rain will result in minor flooding.",
        "instruction": "Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nExcessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of small\ncreeks and streams, country roads, farmland, and other low lying\nspots.\n\nIn hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are\npotentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded\nroads. Find an alternate route.\n\nA Flood Advisory means river or stream flows are elevated, or ponding\nof water in urban or other areas is occurring or is imminent.",
