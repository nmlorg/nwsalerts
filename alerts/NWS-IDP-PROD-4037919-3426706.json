The rapid accumulation of snow will\nmake travel extremely difficult, if not impossible. If travel is\nnecessary, make sure to exercise extreme caution. Begin your\ntravel with a full tank of gas, and carry a winter storm kit\nwhich includes a shovel, flashlight, cellphone, food and water,\nand blankets of extra warm clothing.\n\nA Winter Weather Advisory is issued for a variety of winter\nweather conditions, such as snow, blowing snow, sleet, or\nfreezing drizzle and rain. It only takes a small amount of wintry\nprecipitation to make roads, bridges, sidewalks, and parking lots\nicy and dangerous. It is often difficult to tell when ice begins\nto form, so do not be caught off guard.\n\nIn Illinois, the latest road conditions can be obtained on the\nInternet at www.gettingaroundillinois.com.
