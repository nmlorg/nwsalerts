In addition, with temperatues falling quickly tonight,\nany wet surfaces and roadways are expected to flash freeze and\ncause further travel issues.\n\n* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3\ninches.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of east central and northeast Kansas and\ncentral, north central and west central Missouri.\n\n* WHEN...From 9 AM this morning to midnight CST tonight.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
