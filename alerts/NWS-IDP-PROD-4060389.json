        "description": "Later tonight, winds coming from the southwest will increase in\nspeed as a strong pocket of winds just above the surface tracks\nacross the region. Sustained winds are expected to remain around\n15 to 20 mph with wind gusts approaching 30 to 40 mph at times,\nespecially in more open and exposed areas. Locations across the\nhigher terrain of Marquette and Baraga counties, and communities\nalong the Lake Superior shoreline will have the potential to see\nhigher gusts up to 45 mph.\n\nThe combination of colder temperatures and these gusty winds will\ncause wind chill values to fall to 5 to 15 below zero, with the\ncoldest conditions expected between 9 PM EST and 4 AM EST. If you\nplan on spending time outside tonight, dress in warm layers and\nprepare for blustery conditions. With some fresh snow on the\nground, it is possible these gusty winds may cause some blowing\nand drifting snow, especially in locations that are more open and\nexposed to southwest winds.\n\nAlso, ice in and along the shoreline of Lake Superior may become\nunstable, or even push offshore due to the brisk southwest winds\nexpected.\n\nPlease visit weather.gov/up for the latest weather information.",
