        "description": "A low pressure system, currently near the Gulf of California, will\nslowly track to the east over Old Mexico through Wednesday. This\nwill spread precipitation over the Land of Enchantment, mostly\nduring the day Tuesday through Tuesday night and Wednesday before\nending that afternoon. Snow levels will be quite high with this\nstorm system, with any appreciable snow accumulations generally\nstaying above 8,000 feet during the day Tuesday before lowering to\n6,000 to 7,000 feet Tuesday night. While the high peaks near\nSierra Blanca might receive several inches of accumulations,\nperiods of rain and occasional modest snow amounts of just a few\ninches are expected in Ruidoso. Scattered to widespread areas of\nrainfall are then expected in the lower elevations, particularly\nthe plains of Chaves county where some locations may exceed an\ninch of rainfall.\n\nAnyone planning travel in southern New Mexico Tuesday through\nWednesday should be prepared for potential adverse weather\nconditions. In the high elevations, icy or snow-covered roads and\nlow visibility in fog and snow may exist. Monitor NOAA weather\nradio, weather.gov/abq or your local media for the latest weather\nupdates. For the latest New Mexico road conditions visit\nnmroads.com or call 5-1-1.",
