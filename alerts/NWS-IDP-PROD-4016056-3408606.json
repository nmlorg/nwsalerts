Winds could gust as\nhigh as 40 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Kodiak Island.\n\n* WHEN...From late Friday night through Saturday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Heavy snow and\nblowing snow could produce white-out conditions at times.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow and blowing snow are expected to\ndevelop by midnight Friday with the heaviest snow and\nstrongest winds occurring through mid-morning Saturday. It is\npossible that enough warm air moves in by late morning to\nchange the snow to a mix of rain and snow by the end of the\nevent; however, there is still quite a bit of uncertainty\nregarding this scenario.",
