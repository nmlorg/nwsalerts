The hazardous conditions could impact the morning\nand evening commutes. There will also be increased avalanche\ndanger for backcountry recreation.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snowfall will decrease somewhat this\nafternoon, possibly allowing it to partially melt on lower\nelevation roadways, then refreeze this evening. Snowfall will\nincrease again overnight, creating a greater icing hazard.",
