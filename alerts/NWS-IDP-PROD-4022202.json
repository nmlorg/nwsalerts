        "description": "South-southwest winds will increase into the 25 to 40 mph range\nlate tonight along and east of the Buffalo Ridge. The strong winds\nwill persist through Tuesday and Tuesday evening, before slowly\ndiminishing late Tuesday night. Isolated gusts to 45 mph will be\npossible during the afternoon and evening.\n\nThese strong winds will likely create areas of blowing and\ndrifting snow, with slick roads and reduced visibility possible.\nBe especially cautious during the day Tuesday, when sunshine may\nheat pavement enough to melt the drifting snow, which could then\nquickly refreeze, as air temperatures will still be well below\nfreezing.",
