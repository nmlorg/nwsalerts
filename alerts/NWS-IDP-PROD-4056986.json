        "description": "The leading edge of an arctic front extended from south of\nWisconsin Rapids to just north of Waupaca to Kimberly to northern\nManitowoc County as of 9 pm. As the front passes, a period of\nmoderate snow with visibilities of around a half of mile can be\nexpected, especially across Waupaca, Outagamie, Calumet and\nManitowoc Counties. Wind gusts to around 35 mph are also possible\nwith the passage of the front. The arctic front should exit the\narea by 10 pm.\n\nThe combination of the falling snow, along with melting snow on\npavement surfaces and falling air temperatures well below freezing\ncould lead to a flash freeze by late evening. Gusty northerly\nwinds may also create some areas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nOvernight, temperatures are expected to fall into the single\ndigits to around 10 above zero. The combination of the cold\ntemperatures and gusty northerly winds will produce wind chill\nreadings down to around 10 below zero late tonight into Thursday\nmorning. Wind chill readings this low can produce frost bite in 30\nminutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving tonight as roads\nwill be slippery due to ice or snow. If venturing outdoors overnight,\nwear layers of clothing along with a hat and gloves to protect\nyourself from the cold.",
