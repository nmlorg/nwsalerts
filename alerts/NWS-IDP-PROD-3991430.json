        "description": "Patchy fog overnight is expected to expand across portions of Deep\nSouth Texas and the Rio Grande Valley over the next few hours as a\ncold front approaches. Visibility may generally be reduced to 1\nto 3 miles, with locally dense fog reducing visibilities to less\nthan one half mile at times. Any fog is expected to dissipate\nnear sunrise this morning, after the passage of the weak cold\nfront and northerly winds increase.\n\nMotorists are advised to drive with caution this morning as\nvisibilities may change rapidly over short distances. Use low beam\nheadlights and leave extra distance between your vehicle and\nothers on the road when encountering significant reductions in\nvisibility. Allow extra time to travel to destinations.",
