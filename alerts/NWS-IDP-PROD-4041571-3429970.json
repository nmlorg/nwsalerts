This will cause minor flooding in the advisory area.\nUp to two inches of rain have fallen over the past 12 hours, which\nhas created swollen streams and low-lying and urban flooding\nconditions. This area will be watched for a possible upgrade to a\nwarning if heavy rainfall persists.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nHartwell, Reed Creek, Bowersville, Nuberg, Vanna, Royston, Canon\nand Lake Hartwell.",

Rapid rises on small creeks and streams will also occur,\npossibly flooding low water crossings and farmland. Do not attempt to\ntravel across flooded roads. Turn around, dont drown.\n\nOnly when it is safe to do so, please report floodwaters or\nlandslides flowing over roads or threatening property to the National\nWeather Service by calling toll-free, 1, 800, 2 6 7, 8 1 0 1, by\nposting on our Facebook page, or via Twitter using hashtag NWSGSP.\nYour message should describe the event and the specific location\nwhere it occurred, including roadways, nearby cross streets, stream\nnames, and other landmarks.",
