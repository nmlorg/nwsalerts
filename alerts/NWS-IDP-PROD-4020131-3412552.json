For the Small Craft Advisory, northwest\nwinds 15 to 25 kt with gusts up to 30 kt expected.\n\n* WHERE...Sheboygan to Port Washington WI, Port Washington to\nNorth Point Light WI, North Point Light to Wind Point WI and\nWind Point WI to Winthrop Harbor IL.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, until noon CST\ntoday. For the Small Craft Advisory, until 3 PM CST this\nafternoon.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nInexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller\nvessels, should avoid navigating in hazardous conditions.",
