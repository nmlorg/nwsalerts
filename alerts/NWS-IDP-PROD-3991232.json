        "description": "Moisture crossing western North Carolina this morning ahead of a\nlow pressure system and associated cold front will produce mainly\na cold rain across the North Carolina foothills. However, the\nprecipitation could start out as a mixture of snow, sleet, and\nfreezing rain in some locations around daybreak, and spotty ice\nor snow accumulations will be possible through mid-morning. The\nprecipitation will end quickly later in the morning hours, with\ntemperatures rebounding into the 40s this afternoon.\n\nUse caution if traveling across the northern foothills of western\nNorth Carolina this morning. Spotty ice accumulations from\nfreezing rain or sleet could create slippery surfaces in areas\nwhere the temperature briefly dips to 32 degrees.",
