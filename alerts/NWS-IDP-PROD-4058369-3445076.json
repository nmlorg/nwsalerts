For the Gale Watch, from Friday\nafternoon through Saturday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds can cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible\nhazardous conditions.  Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter\ncourse, and/or secure the vessel for severe wind and waves.",
