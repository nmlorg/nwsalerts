        "description": "...Periods of Heavy Rainfall This Evening and Overnight...\n\n.A storm system will bring a band of heavy rainfall to coastal\nareas of Humboldt and Del Norte counties this evening into the\nfirst half of the overnight. Additional showers are expected later\ntonight into Thursday morning. With persistent light rain over\nthe last week, creeks and streams are already elevated. This\nquick period of additional heavy rain will likely result in some\nsmall streams and creeks overtopping their banks on the coastal\nplain. Localized urban flooding will also be possible. Farther\ninland heavy snow is expected in the mountains resulting in a\nlower threat of flooding.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Eureka has issued a\n\n* Flood Watch for a portion of northwest California, including the\nfollowing areas, coastal Del Norte and coastal Humboldt counties.\n\n* From 6 PM PST this evening through Thursday morning\n\n* One to two inches of rain is expected on top of saturated\nsoils. This will result in rising small streams and creeks with\nsome overtopping their banks. Localized urban flooding will also\nbe possible. Main stem river flooding is not expected.\n\n* Some creeks and streams that may flood include Jacoby Creek, Elk\nRiver, Freshwater Creek, Coffee Creek, Hookton Slough, Martin\nSlough, and other low lying areas. Some roads that may be\nimpacted in Humboldt County include Berta Road, Coffee Creek\nRoad, Hookton Road, Howard Heights Road, Myrtle Avenue, Old\nArcata Road, and Graham Road. Lake Earl Drive near the Smith\nRiver, Fred D Haight Drive, and other low lying areas may see\nflooding in Del Norte County.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
