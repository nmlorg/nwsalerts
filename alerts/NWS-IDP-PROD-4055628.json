Ice jams will also be possible, with the highest risk\nalong the Rock River, Fox River, and lower Kankakee River. Ice\njams may cause rises on area rivers with little warning.\n\nThis outlook means that elevated river levels and potential\nimpacts are possible, but the timing, extent, and severity remain\nuncertain. Persons with interests along area rivers should closely\nmonitor the latest forecasts.",
