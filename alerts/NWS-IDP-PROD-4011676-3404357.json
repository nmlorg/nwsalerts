Precipitation is expected to\nstart off as snow then transition to rain late Friday into Friday\nnight.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River at Seymour.\n* until Thursday evening.\n* At  7:45 AM Wednesday the stage was 16.0 feet.\n* Flood stage is 12.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by\nThursday morning.\n* At 16.0 feet...Extensive lowland flooding affecting agricultural\nlands.
