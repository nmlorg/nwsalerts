Wet\nsoil conditions along with the lack of vegetation in the winter will\ncause rainfall to runoff quickly resulting in potential\nflooding.\n\n* Flooding of low water crossings and low lying roadways near\nstreams, creeks, and rivers will be possible, creating\npotentially dangerous travel conditions on roads susceptible to\nflooding. Flooded low water crossing are hard to see at night\nwhile driving, so use caution.",
