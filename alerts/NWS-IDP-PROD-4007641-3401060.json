This will cause urban and small\nstream flooding. Overflowing poor drainage areas will result in\nminor flooding in the advisory area, especially as ditches and\nculverts fill and small streams overflow their banks. Excessive\nponding on roadways is also expected. One to two inches inches of\nrain have already fallen since yesterday evening, and another inch\nor more is possible today.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nColumbia, Sumter, Lexington, West Columbia, Cayce, Forest Acres,\nCamden, Bishopville, Springdale, Dentsville, Oak Grove, McEntire\nAir Base, Red Bank, St. Andrews, South Congaree, Pine Ridge,\nGaston, Arcadia Lakes, Eastover and Lugoff.",
