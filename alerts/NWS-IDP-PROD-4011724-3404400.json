Amounts of just a glazing across the\nwest and central are expected, with amounts between four to six\nhundredths of an inch are possible across eastern Iowa. This will\nimpact the morning commute.\n\n* WHAT...Freezing drizzle. Additional ice accumulations of a light\nglaze. Freezing fog which will reduce visibility to a quarter\nmile or less and may deposit ice on untreated and elevated\nsurfaces.\n\n* WHERE...Central and northern Iowa.\n\n* WHEN...Until noon CST today.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery roads, bridges and sidewalks this\nmorning. Freezing fog will also complicate matters due to low\nvisibility and potential deposition of ice especially on\nuntreated and elevated surfaces. Multiple accidents were\nreported on highways and interstates earlier this morning.\nTreated surfaces are improving but untreated surfaces are still\nvery slick and will likely not improve until the fog lifts.",
