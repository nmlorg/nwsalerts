        "description": "Narrow, northwest-southeast oriented bands of snow will occur\nthrough midnight tonight across Natrona County. These snow bands\nwill be very localized in nature. It appears that the most\nsnowfall from these snow bands will be concentrated across western\nNatrona County, as well as across Casper Mountains, where one to\nthree inches of snow will accumulate in some areas, over a\nrelatively short period of time. Less snowfall will likely fall\nin most other areas.\n\nTravelers should anticpate rapidly fluctuating visibility along\nwith changing road conditions where highways become rapidly slick\nand snow covered. Much of this snowfall will likely diminish by\nmidnight.",
