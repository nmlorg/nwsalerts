        "description": "Latest surface observations and Department of Transportation\ncameras showed areas fog across east central and southeast Iowa.\nSome pockets of dense fog were also noted, with visibilities at\nIndependence and Cedar Rapids reduced to less that a quarter of a\nmile. This fog was occurring ahead of widespread light snow over\ncentral Iowa, which has been slowly progressing east early this\nmorning.\n\nVisibilities in the fog will be less than a mile with the\npotential for 1/4 mile or less in spots. As the fog builds east\nthrough the morning, improvements in visibilities are expected.\n\nMotorists should drive with extra caution and allow additional\ntravel time. Use low beams, reduce speed, and allow for plenty of\nroom between you and other cars.",
