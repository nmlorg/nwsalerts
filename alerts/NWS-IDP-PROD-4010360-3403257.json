        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nEast Fork White River...Wabash River...White River...\n\n\n.As of early Tuesday evening, minor to moderate flooding continues on\nthe Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers in central and\nsouthern Indiana.  Flooding has ended along most of the creeks and\nsmaller rivers.  Flooding is the result of up to about 4 inches of\nrain that fell late last week.\n\nThe large majority of the Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers\nare either in flood or expected to flood, with some locations\nreaching moderate flood stage.  Crests are expected to be the\nhighest since either February or June of 2019.\n\nThe Wabash River is cresting or past crest from Covington to Terre\nHaute.  The crest on the White River was between Elliston and\nNewberry.  The crest along the East Fork White River was between\nSeymour and Rivervale. Flooding along the lower portions of the White\nand Wabash River is likely to continue through the end of the month.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday,\nwhich will allow drainage to continue out of area rivers this week.\nAbove normal precipitation is possible this coming Friday into\nSaturday, which could exacerbate elevated water levels and lead to\nrenewed flooding on area waterways.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Mount Carmel.\n* until further notice.\n* At  4:45 PM Tuesday the stage was 23.5 feet.\n* Flood stage is 19.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Moderate flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue rising to near 27.4 feet by late Sunday\nnight then begin falling.\n* At 27.5 feet...In the City of Mt. Carmel, all local roads flooded\neast of the levee except for South Division.",
