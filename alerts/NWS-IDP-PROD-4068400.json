        "description": "A disturbance moving through the Deep South is producing light\nprecipitation across areas along the Tennessee, Kentucky, and\nVirginia state line. The precipitation will fall as snow at\nelevations generally around 2000 feet and higher. While\nprecipitation is expected to fall as rain and/or snow at times\nbelow 2000 feet, temperatures will generally remain above\nfreezing.

The most likely location for accumulations is at\nelevations above about 2000 feet, where 1 inch is possible, and 2\ninches possible above 3000 feet. This may affect travel through\nmid afternoon at the highest elevations and mountain passes such\nas Pine and Black Mountains or the Log Mountains of western Bell\nCounty.",
