Flooding has ended on most\nor all creeks and smaller rivers.  Flooding is the result of up to\nabout 4 inches of rain that fell late last week.\n\nCrests will be/are comparable to those that occurred in February\nand June of 2019.\n\nThe Wabash River is either cresting or slightly past crest from\nCovington to Terre Haute.  The crest will reach Hutsonville\nmid-day Thursday.  The White River crest is between Elliston and\nNewberry.  The crest along the East Fork White River is nearing\nnearing Rivervale where it should top out at about 28.9 feet\nmid-day Wednesday.  Flooding along the lower portions of the White\nand Wabash River is likely to continue until the weekend of\nJanuary 25.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday,\nwhich will allow drainage to continue out of area rivers this week.\nAbove normal precipitation is possible this coming Friday through\nSaturday, which could exacerbate elevated water levels and lead to\nrenewed flooding on area waterways.  Precipitation is expected to\nstart off as snow then transition to rain late Friday into Friday\nnight.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River below Eagle Valley Power Plant.\n* until late Wednesday night.\n* There have been no observations in the last 24 hours.\n* Flood stage is 603.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It is forecast to crest at 604.5 feet late tonight and\nwill fall below flood stage by Wednesday afternoon.\n* At 603.5 feet...Blue Bluff Road just north of Blue Bluff Bridge has\nabout six inches of water on it.",
