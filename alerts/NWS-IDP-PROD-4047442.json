The freezing drizzle along with a thin coating of\nlight snow in some areas, will make for slippery travel in spots.\nIf you are planning to travel overnight be prepared to encounter\npatches of ice leading to slick conditions. If a roadway appears\nwet it most likely has a thin layer of ice and will be slick.\nSlow down and use extra caution while driving, and be especially\ncautious on bridges and overpasses.",
