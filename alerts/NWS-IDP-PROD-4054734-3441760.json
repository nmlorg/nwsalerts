        "description": "...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS EXPECTED IN WESTERN MINNESOTA WEDNESDAY...\n...DANGEROUS WIND CHILLS EXPECTED WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH\nTHURSDAY MORNING...\n\n.A Blizzard Warning remains in effect for portions of west\ncentral and southwest Minnesota starting 6 am Wednesday morning,\nand continues through the afternoon. A Winter Storm Watch with\npossible blizzard conditions surrounds the blizzard warning in\nwest central, southwest and south central Minnesota for the same\ntime period. Wind Chill Warnings remain in effect for west\ncentral through southwestern Minnesota, with Wind Chill Advisories\nin place for east central Minnesota, portions of southeast\nMinnesota and far western Wisconsin for Wednesday night into\nThursday morning.\n\nConfidence has increased that portions of west central and\nsouthwest Minnesota, mainly west of a Morris to Redwood Falls to\nSt. James line, will have blizzard conditions developing behind a\nstrong Arctic front on Wednesday. The combination of strong gusty\nwinds and whiteout conditions will lead to blizzard conditions\nfor several hours. Confidence is lower on wind speeds farther to\nthe east and thus a Winter Storm Watch has been issued.\n\nOutside the warning and watch area, significant blowing and\ndrifting snow is likely, with locally one to two inches of snow\nby the afternoon.\n\nIn addition to the blizzard conditions, temperatures will drop\noff sharply behind the Arctic front. Wind chill values will drop\n30 degrees below zero by the afternoon in west central Minnesota,\nwith wind chills likely dropping to 35 degrees below zero by the\nevening, persisting through Thursday morning. In eastern\nMinnesota into western Wisconsin, wind chills will drop to\nbetween 25 and 35 degrees below zero late Wednesday night through\nThursday morning. Outside the warning and watch area, significant\nblowing and drifting snow is likely, with locally one to two\ninches of snow by the afternoon.\n\n* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Advisory, very cold wind chills\nexpected. Wind chills as low as 35 below zero. For the Winter\nStorm Watch, blizzard conditions possible. Total snow\naccumulations of up to one inch possible. Winds could gust as\nhigh as 35 mph.\n\n* WHERE...McLeod and Meeker Counties.\n\n* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Advisory, from 10 PM Wednesday to 10\nAM CST Thursday. For the Winter Storm Watch, from 9 AM CST\nWednesday through Wednesday afternoon.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing\nsnow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous\nconditions could impact the morning or evening commute. The\ndangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed\nskin in as little as 10 minutes.",
