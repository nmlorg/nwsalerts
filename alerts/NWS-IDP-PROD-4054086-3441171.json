        "description": "...Potential for Blowing Snow and Dangerous Cold Ahead...\n\n.A strong Arctic cold front passes through the state Wednesday\nafternoon and evening. Gusty northwest winds and light snow\nimmediately behind the front may lead to areas of blowing snow\nover northern Iowa, including the potential for near-blizzard\nconditions in northwest Iowa where recent appreciable snowfall has\noccurred. Rapidly falling temperatures also accompany the front,\nwhich could lead to a flash freeze if local roads are in a wet or\nslushy condition.\n\nBitter cold temperatures and breezy winds combine to drop wind\nchill values to dangerously cold levels late Wednesday night into\nThursday morning.\n\n* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind chills\nexpected. Wind chills as low as 40 below zero. For the Winter\nWeather Advisory, light snow and blowing snow expected. Total\nsnow accumulations of up to one inch. Winds gusting as high as\n40 mph will create areas of blowing snow and possible near-\nblizzard conditions at times.\n\n* WHERE...Northwest Iowa.\n\n* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, from 4 AM to noon CST\nThursday. For the Winter Weather Advisory, from 3 PM Wednesday\nto 4 AM CST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Blowing snow could\nsignificantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions could\nimpact the evening commute. The dangerously cold wind chills\ncould cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10\nminutes.",
        "instruction": "Avoid outside activities if possible. When outside, make sure you\nwear appropriate clothing, a hat, and gloves.\n\nSlow down and use caution while traveling.\n\nThe latest road conditions for the state you are calling from can\nbe obtained by calling 5 1 1.",
