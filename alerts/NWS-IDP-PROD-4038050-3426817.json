        "description": "...Series of Canadian Winter Storms Will Bring Moderate to Heavy\nSnow to the Mountains and Highlands of eastern Idaho...\n\n.A series of winter storms moving in from Canada and across\ncentral and eastern Idaho will bring consistent snowfall to the\nregion starting Wednesday morning and continuing through Friday\nafternoon. Snow and rain will mix at low elevations at times,\nreducing the total snowfall for the populated cities. However, for\nthe eastern highlands from the Montana border southward to the\nUtah border expect all snow, with heavy snow (10 to 20 inches over\ntwo and a half days) in the big Hole Mountains and the Centennial\nMountains and Island Park area. Elsewhere in the Idaho-Wyoming\nborder region, moderate snow (6 to 12 inches over two and a half\ndays) is expected in the Teton Valley, the Caribou highlands,\nBlackfoot Mountains, and the Bear River Mountains. Snowfall rates\nwill be consistent once snow gets started on Wednesday morning.\nStarting Thursday afternoon, the snowfall will be combined with\nmoderate to strong wind to cause reduced visibility in blowing\nsnow and travel problems with heavy drifting of snow.\n\nAlso on Thursday, moderate snow will intensify in the Sawtooth\nMountains and Stanley basin to cause similar issues for those\nliving and traveling to the area.\n\nSnowfall should start to decrease Friday afternoon.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 8 to 22\ninches over a two and a half day period, except 12 to 26 inches\non ridge tops and elevations above passes. Winds gusting as high\nas 35 mph. The snow will fall at a consistent rate during this\ntime.\n\n* WHERE...The Centennial and Big Hole Mountains, the Island Park\narea including the towns of Island Park, Kilgore, and Victor.\n\n* WHEN...From 11 AM Wednesday to 5 PM MST Friday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The\nhazardous conditions could impact the morning or evening\ncommute.",
