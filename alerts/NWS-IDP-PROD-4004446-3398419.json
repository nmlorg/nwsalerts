Stay away from windows as flying debris\ngenerated by damaging winds can be deadly.\n\nIntense thunderstorm lines can produce brief tornadoes and widespread\nsignificant wind damage. Although a tornado is not immediately\nlikely, it is best to move to an interior room on the lowest floor of\na building. These storms may cause serious injury and significant\nproperty damage.",
