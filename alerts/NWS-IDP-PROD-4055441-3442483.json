In northeast Georgia...Towns and\nWhite. In northwest Georgia...Bartow...Catoosa...Chattooga...\nDade...Floyd...Gordon...Murray...Polk...Walker and Whitfield.\n\n* From 7 PM EST this evening through Thursday afternoon\n\n* A cold front will push through Georgia tonight through\nThursday. This front will bring another round of locally heavy\nrainfall to much of north Georgia. Rainfall amounts of one to\ntwo inches will be likely, with locally higher amounts\npossible. Soils remain saturated and several rivers, creeks\nand streams remain near or in flood, so any additional\nrainfall will only create run off and exacerbate ongoing\nflooding conditions.\n\n* Flash flooding and minor to moderate flooding of larger creeks\nand rivers is expected. This will close some roads and could\nflood homes and businesses in flood-prone areas. Along larger\ncreeks and rivers, flooding could last for several days.",
