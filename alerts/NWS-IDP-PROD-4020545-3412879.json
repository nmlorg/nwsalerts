        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nEast Fork White River...Eel River...Wabash River...White River...\n\n\n.Minor to moderate flooding continued Sunday morning in central and\nsouthern Indiana on the major rivers.  Crests will be/are comparable\nto those that occurred in February and June of 2019.  Minor\nflooding developed late Saturday afternoon on the Eel River that\nwill come to an end this afternoon.\n\nA mix of precipitation Friday and Saturday totaled as high as\napproximately 1.50 inches, which will slow river falls or bring\nlower secondary crests on the major rivers, and produce additional\nminor flooding on smaller ones.  Flooding has returned to Seymour on\nthe East Fork White River, and this afternoon it will return to\nSpencer on the White River.  The Driftwood River near Edinburgh will\nbe near bankfull, with a crest near flood stage Sunday morning.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers will\ncontinue until about Wednesday, January 29.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is forecast through midday Thursday.  This\nwill give area waterways several days to drain and return to near\nnormal levels.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Eel River at Bowling Green.\n* until late tonight.\n* At 9:30 AM Sunday the stage was 15.7 feet.\n* Flood stage is 15.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by this\nafternoon.\n* At 16.0 feet...Lowland flooding is occurring along portions of the\nriver.  Sonnefield Road at McIntyre Creek is impassable.  Water is\non portions of Pioneer Road in the vicinity of CR 50 N. This level\nthreatens campers.",
