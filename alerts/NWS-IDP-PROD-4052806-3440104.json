More significant\nriver rises are possible so concerned residents are encouraged to follow\nthe latest forecasts and product updates for the latest information.\n\nThe Flood Advisory is extended for\nthe Tuckasegee River At Bryson City\n* until Tuesday afternoon.\n* At 10 PM Monday the stage was 6.0 feet and rising steadily.\n* Action Stage is 8.0 feet.\n* Minor Flood Stage is 10.0 feet.\n* FORECAST: The river will rise to near 9.5 feet by Tuesday evening.\n* IMPACTS: At 10.0 feet: Low lying areas between Bryson Walk and the\nriver will flood. Upstream between Main Street and the river, low\nlying areas including parts of the Bear Hunter Campground will\nflood.\n* IMPACTS: At 8.0 feet: River will overflow its banks and will begin\nto move into the Bear Hunter Campground near Bryson City.",
