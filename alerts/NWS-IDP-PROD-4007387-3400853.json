        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nBig Blue River...Driftwood River...East Fork White River...Eel\nRiver...Flatrock River...Mill Creek...Sugar Creek...Wabash River...\nWhite River...Wildcat Creek...\n\n.Minor to moderate flooding continues on many waterways in central\nand southern Indiana as of Monday morning.  This is a result of\nup to about 4 inches of rain that fell late last week and the\nweekend.\n\nThe large majority of the Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers\nare either in flood or expected to flood, with some locations\nreaching moderate flood stage.  Crests are expected to be the\nhighest since either February or June of 2019.\n\nAs of Monday morning, flooding had ended along many of the smaller\nstreams with minor to moderate flooding occurring along the main\nstem rivers. The Wabash River was rising along the full length.  The\ncrest along the White River was near Ravenswood. The crest along the\nEast Fork White River was between Seymour and Rivervale. Flooding\nalong the lower portions of the White and Wabash River is likely to\ncontinue through the end of the month.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday which\nwill allow smaller rivers to continue to recede this week.\nAdditional heavy rainfall of 1 to 2 inches is possible this weekend\nwhich could exacerbate ongoing flooding.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River at Petersburg.\n* until further notice.\n* At  9:30 AM Monday the stage was 22.4 feet.\n* Flood stage is 16.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Moderate flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue rising to near 24.6 feet by Saturday\nmorning then begin falling.\n* At 24.2 feet...During April 2013 when Petersburg reached this level,\nthe water only reached the white line of SR 257 south of\nWashington, but never closed the road.  Shoals only went to 11.67\nfeet during April 2013.  This is the first that locals can remember\nsuch a high stage for Petersburg and SR 257 remaining open.",
        "instruction": "Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...\n\nMotorists should never drive into flood water. Turn around and go\nanother way. Keep children away from flooded areas. Recreational and\nagricultural interests should remain alert to changing river\nconditions.\n\nFor detailed flood information go to weather.gov/ind on the web and\nclick on rivers and lakes.",
