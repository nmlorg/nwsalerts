For the Heavy Freezing Spray\nWarning, heavy freezing spray at a rate of 2 centimeters per\nhour or greater expected, and may rapidly accumulate on vessels.\n\n* WHERE...Lake Michigan from Sturgeon Bay WI to Point Betsie MI\nsouthward.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, until 6 AM CST Sunday. For the\nHeavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 6 PM this evening to noon\nCST Sunday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility. Operating a\nvessel in heavy freezing spray is hazardous. Freezing spray\nmay render mechanical and electronic components inoperative.\nRapid ice accretion on decks and superstructures may result in\na catastrophic loss of stability.",

If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
