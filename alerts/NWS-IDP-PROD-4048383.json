        "description": ".RAINFALL EXPECTED...\nAnother strong storm system will approach the state on Monday\nbringing prolonged heavy rain. Current forecasts indicate 2 to 4\ninches of rain just from Monday morning through Tuesday afternoon.\nThe heaviest amounts are expected over north Georgia where\nisolated areas may see up to 5 inches. Light to moderate rain is\nexpected to linger into Wednesday with yet another round of heavy\nrain possible on Thursday.\n\n.ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS...\nVery heavy rain from earlier this week produced 3 to 6 inches of\nrain across all of north and central Georgia with the highest\namounts falling over north Georgia. Streamflow remains very high,\nwith much above normal conditions being observed. With the\nanticipated heavy rain, many rivers will be unable to handle the\nexpected runoff.\n\n.IMPACTS...\nWidespread minor to moderate river flooding and flash flooding is\nlikely for much of north Georgia and will be possible over middle\nGeorgia as well. Roads will become closed and property\nsusceptible to flooding will be at risk.\n\n.ACTIONS...\nStay alert to the latest forecasts and information. A Flash Flood\nor Flood Watch may be issued for north Georgia and possibly\nfurther south. Know what county you are in and the names of\nrivers and creeks in your area. Mentally rehearse what to do if a\nFlash Flood Warning is issued, particularly if you are driving or\nlive or are visiting an area near a creek or river.\n\nFor additional hydrologic information, visit our website at\nweather.gov/atlanta.
