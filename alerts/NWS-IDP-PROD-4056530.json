        "description": "An arctic cold front was plunging southward across northeast\nWisconsin early this evening. The leading edge of the arctic front\nextended from south of Wausau to just south of Marinette as of 7\npm. The arctic front should pass through the Fox Valley and the\nlake shore region south of Sturgeon Bay by 9 pm. The arctic front\nwill be noted by a wind shift to the north or northwest with\nsustained winds of 20 to 30 mph with gusts to 35 mph, and a\nsudden drop in air temperatures.\n\nLight snow continues early this evening across the Fox Valley and\nlakeshore region. The snow is expected to linger into early\nThursday morning. Snowfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected\nby daybreak on Thursday.\n\nThe combination of the falling snow, along with melting snow on\npavement surfaces and falling air temperatures well below freezing\ncould lead to a flash freeze by mid to late evening. Gusty northerly\nwinds may also create some areas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nOvernight, temperatures are expected to fall into the single\ndigits to around 10 above zero. The combination of the cold\ntemperatures and gusty northerly winds will produce wind chill\nreadings down to around 10 below zero late tonight into Thursday\nmorning. Wind chill readings this low can produce frost bite in 30\nminutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving this evening as\nroads will become slippery due to ice or snow. If venturing\noutdoors overnight, wear layers of clothing along with a hat and\ngloves to protect yourself from the cold.",
