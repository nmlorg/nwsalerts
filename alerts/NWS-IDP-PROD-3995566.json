        "description": "A developing winter storm system approaching from the mid-\nMississippi Valley will bring the potential for moderate to heavy\nsnow, mainly for central and eastern Upper Michigan Saturday\nnight into early Sunday. The expected snow with this system\nshould be much lighter and fluffier than the dense, high water\ncontent snow we have experienced with previous storm systems this\nseason. This fluffier snow should make removal somewhat easier\nbehind the storm and lessen potential impacts on trees and power\nlines.\n\nAccompanying the potential for moderate to heavy snowfall will\nalso be gusty northeast winds. These strong northeast winds will\nhave the potential to gust as high as 35 to 40 mph near the Lake\nSuperior shoreline and along the Bay of Green Bay in southern\nMenominee County. These stronger winds may cause considerable\nblowing and drifting of snow and greatly reduced visibility at\ntimes.\n\nThe strong northeast winds could also cause minor lakeshore\nflooding and beach erosion late Saturday into early Sunday for\nlocations along Lake Superior from Marquette through Keweenaw Bay,\nand also along the Bay of Green Bay from Cedar River to Menominee.\n\nThose planning travel or recreational activities in Upper Michigan\nlater this weekend, need to stay tuned to the latest forecasts\nand updated statements on this potential winter storm.",
