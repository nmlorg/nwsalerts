Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3\ninches.\n\n* WHERE...Allegan, Barry, Eaton and Ingham counties.\n\n* WHEN...From noon Sunday to midnight EST Sunday night.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The snow will begin around noon, become\nheavy at times into the evening then diminish to light snow or\neven drizzle in the evening. Most of the storm total snowfall\nwill occur by early evening. Temperatures will remain below\nfreezing until the cold front comes through. At that point winds\nwill turn from the east to the southwest and that will being\nwarmer air from Lake Michigan into the area so temperatures will\nrise to just above freezing for a few hours before enough cold\nair comes in to bring the temperature below freezing. This will\nlikely result in icy conditions on many roads for the Monday\nmorning commute.",
