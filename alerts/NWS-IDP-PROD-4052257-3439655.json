While the heavy rain and flood threat will\ndiminish late tonight across the Watch area, additional light to\nmoderate rain will redevelop and spread east across the area\nTuesday. The heavy rain threat will again increase Tuesday night\nacross East Texas and Southern Arkansas, before shifting east\nacross North Louisiana Wednesday.\n\n* Widespread rainfall amounts of two to four inches, with isolated\nhigher amounts, are expected across the watch area through\nWednesday afternoon. Given the already saturated grounds, this\nadditional rainfall will quickly runoff, resulting in an\nincreased flash flood threat.",
