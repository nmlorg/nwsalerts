In southwest Arkansas, Calhoun, Clark, Dallas, Hot\nSpring, Ouachita, and Pike.\n\n* Until 6 PM CST this evening\n\n* Periods of showers will be possible over most of the watch\narea, including eastern Arkansas through this evening. Any\nadditional rain falling on saturated soils could result in\nlocalized flash flooding.\n\n* Since vegetation is dormant, and not consuming much ground\nwater, runoff from heavy rain will be increased. This elevates\nthe concern for flash flooding. Also, rapid rises may occur on\ncreeks, small streams, and flashy rivers.",
