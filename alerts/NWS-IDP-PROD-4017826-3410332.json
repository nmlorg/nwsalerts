        "description": "...Winter Storm Continues into Saturday...\n\n.Snow has transitioned to a wintry mix of freezing rain and sleet\nacross much of eastern Iowa and west central Illinois. This\ntransition will continue to move across northwest Illinois the\nrest of the evening. Overnight, the freezing rain and sleet may\ntaper off to freezing drizzle. Total snow and sleet accumulations\nof 2 to 6 inches are likely, along with ice accumulations up to\ntwo tenths of an inch. Strong southeast winds gusting up to 30 to\n35 MPH through this evening when combined with the falling\nprecipitation will further reduce visibilities and cause\ndangerous traveling conditions. By Saturday morning, very strong\nnorthwest winds gusting to 40 to 45 MPH will lead to blowing and\ndrifting snow with greatly reduced visibility. These winds will\ncombine with falling temperatures to produce wind chills down to\n10 below zero to 20 below zero during the evening hours Saturday.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation. Additional snow and sleet\naccumulations of an inch or less. Total ice accumulations of a\ntenth to three tenths possible. Northwest winds gusting up to 40\nmph on Saturday.\n\n* WHERE...Bureau and Putnam Counties.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Difficult travel due to snow covered or icy roads.\nPatchy blowing snow could reduce visibilities on Saturday.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The weight of the ice combined with the\nstrong winds on Saturday could bring down tree branches and\nlead to isolated power outages.",
