Flooding will\nend on all rivers tonight except for the Skokomish and lower\nChehalis Rivers. More precipitation in on tap for Friday into\nSaturday of 1 to 2.5 inches. However, the snow level over the\nCascades will be too low for storm runoff to cause any flooding.\nOver the Olympics, the snow level could reach 3000 to 4000 feet and\ncould be enough to stall the Skokomish River from falling below\nflood stage or send it back up above flood stage if it is below by\nthen.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Skokomish River At Potlatch\n* From 12 PM Monday until further notice.\n* At  9:30 AM Wednesday the stage was 17.6 feet.\n* Flood stage is 16.5 feet.\n* Moderate flooding is occurring and Moderate flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...The river is falling and will go below moderate flood\nstage this afternoon. It will briefly fall below flood stage\nThursday night before rising above flood stage again Friday.\n* Impact...At 17.5 feet, the Skokomish River will cause moderate\nflooding, with deep and quick flood waters inundating some\nresidential areas, many roads, and much of the farm land in the\nSkokomish Valley. Inundated roads include the Skokomish Valley\nroad, Bourgault Road West, Purdy Cutoff Road, and Highway 106.",
