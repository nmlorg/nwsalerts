However, some of this will\nlinger into late morning west of I-57, as an area of low pressure\nmoves into western Illinois.\n\nTravelers should be alert for slow moving traffic due to the fog.\nThis is especially true where snow fell during the night, as\nsecondary roads remain slushy and quick stops will be difficult.\nSlow down and use low beam headlights.",
