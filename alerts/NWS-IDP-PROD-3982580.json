Any snow cover may cause slippery road conditions especially\nif not treated.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nSpringfield, Chicopee, Westfield, Holyoke, Amherst, Northampton,\nAgawam, West Springfield, Ludlow, South Hadley, Easthampton,\nLongmeadow, Belchertown, Wilbraham, Southwick, Granby, Southampton,\nHadley, Hatfield and Williamsburg.\n\nDrivers need to remain alert. Road conditions can deteriorate\nquickly in wintry weather. These conditions often lead to accidents,\nespecially on highways, since road conditions can change rapidly.\nAvoid braking suddenly. Consider delaying travel until the squalls\npass.",
