        "description": "At 1143 AM EST, an area of light to moderate rain was moving across\nthe region.  This rain coupled with previous rain that occurred\novernight and this morning has caused the Little Muskingum River to\nrise.\n\nAt 1130 AM EST, the stage at Bloomfield was 15.12 feet.  The\nestimated flood stage is 16 feet.  The river is expected to crest\njust under the estimated flood stage early this afternoon.  At\nstages near 16 feet, hay fields across from the gage and between the\nriver and Route 26, and other low lying areas start to flood.\n\nThis rainfall that is occurring, may cause localized flooding. Do\nnot drive your vehicle through flooded roadways.\n\nExcessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause elevated levels on\nsmall creeks and streams, and ponding of water on country roads and\nfarmland along the banks of creeks and streams.",
