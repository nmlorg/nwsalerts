This brings high waves closer to the Lake Huron shoreline\nleading to intensified lakeshore flooding during the day. Winds\nwill then shift to westerly tonight allowing the lakeshore\nflooding threat to subside, although additional minor lakeshore\nflooding will be possible along the far northern shore of Huron\ncounty.",
