The crest along the East Fork White River is nearing\nnearing Rivervale where it should top out at about 28.9 feet\nmid-day Wednesday.  Flooding along the lower portions of the White\nand Wabash River is likely to continue until the weekend of\nJanuary 25.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday,\nwhich will allow drainage to continue out of area rivers this week.\nAbove normal precipitation is possible this coming Friday through\nSaturday, which could exacerbate elevated water levels and lead to\nrenewed flooding on area waterways.  Precipitation is expected to\nstart off as snow then transition to rain late Friday into Friday\nnight.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Hutsonville Legacy Power Plant Site.\n* until Friday January 24.\n* There have been no observations in the last 24 hours.\n* Flood stage is 16.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It is forecast to crest at 21.9 feet Thursday afternoon\nand will fall below flood stage by Friday January 24.\n* At 22.0 feet...River cabins become isolated.
