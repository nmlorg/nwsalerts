Up to two\ninches of snow will be possible in any narrow bands that form,\nthough most areas will receive less than one inch of additional\nsnowfall. Gusty north winds may create areas of blowing snow and\nreduced visibility. Slick roads are also possible. For those\ntravelling along I-25 near Raton Pass, or I-40 between Clines\nCorners and the Texas State line, watch for sudden changes in\nvisibility and changing road conditions.\n\nMonitor NOAA weather radio, weather.gov/abq or your local media\nfor the latest weather updates. For the latest New Mexico road\nconditions visit nmroads.com or call 511.",
