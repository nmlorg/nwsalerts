Intensified shoreline erosion\nwill occur.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong northeast winds will persist through\ntonight. This onshore flow produces high waves and rising water\nlevels resulting in significant shoreline flooding. Low lying\nareas along Saginaw Bay will be particularly susceptible to\nflooding as the water level is forecast to peak near 74 inches\nabove chart datum at Essexville tonight. There is also potential\nfor flooding to extend up the Saginaw River into Bay City.",
