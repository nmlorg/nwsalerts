There may be a narrow\nribbon of one tenth to one quarter of an inch of freezing rain\nnear Cascade Locks, but the heaviest ice accumulations appear\nmost likely to fall above river level. Precipitation appears\nmore likely to fall as snow early tonight around Cascade Locks\nwhere 1 to 3 inches of snow will be possible before\nprecipitation turns to all rain Saturday morning.\n\n* WHERE...Western Columbia River Gorge.\n\n* WHEN...From 10 PM this evening to 8 AM Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Avoid unnecessary travel through the Columbia River\nGorge tonight into Saturday morning.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures are slightly warmer than\nanticipated this evening in the Gorge. In addition, temperatures\naloft appear increasingly likely to support more snow than\nfreezing rain so confidence that significant freezing rain\naccumulations will occur has decreased. We will monitor\ntemperature trends for a few more hours before adjusting the\nforecast further.",
