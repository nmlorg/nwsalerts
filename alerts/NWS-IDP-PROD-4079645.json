        "description": "* Snow: 3 to 5 inches expected at pass levels with locally higher\namounts across Sierra mountain summits. A dusting possible down\ninto the upper foothills.\n\n* Timing: Snow showers will spread from north to south through the\nregion starting Saturday afternoon while becoming heavier into\nthe overnight hours. Showers to continue into Sunday with snow\nlevels falling to around 2,500 feet by the morning hours.\n\n* Temperatures: Saturday's highs will be in the 40s across the\nmountains, while dropping to the upper 20s and 30s on Sunday.\nOvernight lows to reach the teens and 20s each night.\n\n* Winds: Gusty winds at times, particularly across ridgetops. Peak\nwind gusts reaching 50 to 60 mph from Saturday through Monday.\n\n* Impacts: Snow covered roads, mountain travel delays, and\npossible chain controls.\n\n* Synopsis: A cold upper trough arriving from the Gulf of Alaska\nwill bring snow showers to the Sierra from Saturday afternoon\ninto Sunday. The dry nature of this system will generally limit\nsnowfall amounts. In addition to the snow, much cooler\ntemperatures and gusty winds will accompany this trough.",
