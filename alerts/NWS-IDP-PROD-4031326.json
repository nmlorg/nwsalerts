Visibilities should rapidly\nimprove between 9 AM and 10 AM CST as the fog lifts and\ndissipates.\n\nDrivers are urged to slow down and exercise additional caution,\nparticularly at intersections and highway onramps and offramps\nwhere accidents are more likely to occur, and on elevated roadways\nsuch as bridges and overpasses where ice is more likely to\naccrue. Use low beam headlights and be prepared for rapid\nreductions in visibility, especially near rivers, creeks and other\nlow lying areas.",
