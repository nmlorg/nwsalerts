Between 2 and 4\ninches of rain have already fallen across much of northeast\nAlabama, and the additional rainfall will further contribute to\nponding of water on roads and flooding of low lying areas that\nnormally experience poor drainage.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nSouthern Huntsville, Albertville, Cullman, Scottsboro, Hartselle,\nFort Payne, Boaz, Guntersville, Arab and Rainsville.",
