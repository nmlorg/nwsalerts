These swells will\ncontinue to hold through most of night, then gradually decrease\nbeginning Tuesday. This could cause significant beach erosion,\noverwash onto vulnerable low-lying coastal roadways, and surges\nwithin north and west facing harbors such as Haleiwa and Waianae\nthrough tonight.\n\n* WHAT...Surf will be 8 to 12 feet through Tuesday along west\nfacing shores of the Big Island. Some locally higher waves will\nbe possible along select western exposures.\n\n* WHERE...West facing shores of the Big Island.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM HST Tuesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...High...Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping\nacross portions of beaches, very strong breaking waves, and\nstrong longshore and rip currents. Breaking waves may\noccasionally impact harbors making navigating the harbor\nchannel dangerous.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of onshore winds, large\nsurf, and peak monthly tides will could cause beach erosion,\nflooding of beaches that normally remain dry and overwash onto\nvulnerable low-lying coastal roads and other coastal\ninfrastructure.",
