The most\nrobust winds will occur during the early to late afternoon\nhours, especially over west Kentucky and a small part of\nsouthwest Indiana. A diminishing trend will occur by evening.\n\n* WINDS... Southeast to west and northwest winds 20 to 30 mph may\ngust up to 45 mph at times. Winds will all shift to the\nnorthwest after the passage of a cold front.\n\n* IMPACTS... Saturated soils may enable these gusty winds to down\nloosely rooted trees. The strong and variable winds will also\npresent a potential traffic hazard, especially for high profile\nvehicles. These winds may also hamper clearing efforts for those\nlocations damaged by storms early this morning.",
