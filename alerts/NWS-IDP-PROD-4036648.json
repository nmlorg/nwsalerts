        "description": "ESFLMK\n\nA slow-moving cold front will combine with several upper level\ndisturbances crossing the region to produce waves of moderate\nrainfall starting later tonight and continuing through early\nThursday. Areal average rainfall totals over central Kentucky\nlikely will range from 2 to 3 inches. Areas that see the more\npersistent heavier rainfall likely would see higher amounts.\n\nThe first wave of rain is expected late tonight...and the ground\nshould be able to soak in this rain well. Additional rains will\nform Tuesday afternoon and night, with more waves Wednesday and\nWednesday night. During these periods ponding of roadways is\npossible with minor flooding not out of the question. Most area\nrivers and creeks look to handle this rainfall well, but a few\ncould reach minor flood stage...particularly along the Green\nRiver at Woodbury and Rochester.\n\nStay tuned to the latest forecast updates over the next few days.",
