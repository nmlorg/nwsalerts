        "description": "Another weak storm system will bring rain and snow to northeast\nCalifornia, the Sierra, and western Nevada tonight into Sunday.\nSnow levels start rather high tonight, 8000 to 9000 feet, but\nfall to near 5500 to 6000 feet Sunday. Precipitation amounts will\nbe limited and the higher snow levels will limit snow\naccumulations below 7000 feet. Along the Sierra Crest, isolated\nspots could get more than 8 inches of snow, but the higher passes\nthrough the Sierra can expect only 3 to 6 inches. Even this small\namount of snow could cause travel delays by Sunday morning.\n\nAt Lake Tahoe, accumulations up to a couple inches are possible.\nIn Mono County, accumulations should be confined to the mountains\nwest of Highway 395, and only 2 to 5 inches are expected above\n7500 feet, with 4 to 8 inches along the Sierra Crest.\n\nWinds will also increase late Saturday night into Sunday, with\ngusts in the 35 to 40 mph in wind prone areas east of the Sierra\nCrest. For most other areas, gusts should be no higher than 30\nmph. These winds will also cause choppy conditions on Lake Tahoe.",
