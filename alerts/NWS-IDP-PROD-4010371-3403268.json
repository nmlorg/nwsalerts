        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nEast Fork White River...Wabash River...White River...\n\n\n.As of early Tuesday evening, minor to moderate flooding continues on\nthe Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers in central and\nsouthern Indiana.  Flooding has ended along most of the creeks and\nsmaller rivers.  Flooding is the result of up to about 4 inches of\nrain that fell late last week.\n\nThe large majority of the Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers\nare either in flood or expected to flood, with some locations\nreaching moderate flood stage.  Crests are expected to be the\nhighest since either February or June of 2019.\n\nThe Wabash River is cresting or past crest from Covington to Terre\nHaute.  The crest on the White River was between Elliston and\nNewberry.  The crest along the East Fork White River was between\nSeymour and Rivervale. Flooding along the lower portions of the White\nand Wabash River is likely to continue through the end of the month.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday,\nwhich will allow drainage to continue out of area rivers this week.\nAbove normal precipitation is possible this coming Friday into\nSaturday, which could exacerbate elevated water levels and lead to\nrenewed flooding on area waterways.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Terre Haute.\n* until Tuesday January 21.\n* At  5:30 PM Tuesday the stage was 22.1 feet. This is 2.0 to 2.5\nfeet higher than the observations from the old legacy gauge.\n* Flood stage is 16.5 feet. This is 2.5 feet higher than flood stage\nfrom the old legacy gauge.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will rise to near 22.6 feet by Wednesday morning then\nbegin falling. It will fall below flood stage Tuesday January 21.\n* At 22.5 feet...Extensive flooding behind Honey Creek Levee as a\nresult of two unrepaired levee breaks from the April 2013 flood.\nThis levee is maintained by the Honey Creek Levee Association.\nFlood waters behind the Honey Creek levee inundates most roads and\naffects a few residences and or commercial activities.",
        "instruction": "Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...\n\nMotorists should never drive into flood water. Turn around and go\nanother way. Keep children away from flooded areas. Recreational and\nagricultural interests should remain alert to changing river\nconditions.\n\nFor detailed flood information go to weather.gov/ind on the web and\nclick on rivers and lakes.",
