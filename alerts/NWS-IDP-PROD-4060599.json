Locations include, but are not limited\nto Denver, Boulder, Longmont, and Greeley.\n\nWHEN...400 PM Friday February 14 to 400 PM Saturday February 15\n\nIMPACTS...An Action Day for Particulates is now in effect for the\nseven-county Denver-Boulder metropolitan area. Requests to limit\ndriving are now in effect until at least 4 PM Saturday, February\n15, 2020.  Limited mixing and ventilation has increased fine\nparticulate concentrations across portions of the Northern Front\nRange Urban Corridor. Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups level fine\nparticulate matter concentrations are possible on Friday,\ndecreasing during the day Saturday, with Poor visibility is\nexpected Saturday. For areas included in this advisory that are\nnot expected to exceed the Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (USG)\nair quality designation, we request that activities, such as\ndriving, be reduced to lessen the impacts on neighboring air\nquality. Additional air pollution in this region may directly\ndiminish air quality or contribute to precursors which may also\nadversely affect air quality.
