Visibilities\nbetween 1 and 3 miles can be expected posing difficult navigation\nfor unexperienced mariners and pilots. A slow moving cold front\nmoving offshore this evening may even allow for reformation of\ndense fog and another dense fog advisory may be issued if\nvisibilities drop below 1 mile.\n\nIf you must navigate, proceed with caution. Use proper fog\nsignals. Make sure all running lights are on. Remember to use\nyour radar and compass.\n\nStay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio or your local media for further\nupdates.",
