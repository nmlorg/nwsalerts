Crests will be/are comparable\nto those that occurred in February and June of 2019.  Minor\nflooding developed late Saturday afternoon on the Eel River that\nwill come to an end this afternoon.\n\nA mix of precipitation Friday and Saturday totaled as high as\napproximately 1.50 inches, which will slow river falls or bring\nlower secondary crests on the major rivers, and produce additional\nminor flooding on smaller ones.  Flooding has returned to Seymour on\nthe East Fork White River, and this afternoon it will return to\nSpencer on the White River.  The Driftwood River near Edinburgh will\nbe near bankfull, with a crest near flood stage Sunday morning.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers will\ncontinue until about Wednesday, January 29.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is forecast through midday Thursday.  This\nwill give area waterways several days to drain and return to near\nnormal levels.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River near Bedford.\n* until late tonight.\n* There have been no observations in the last 24 hours.\n* Flood stage is 20.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It is forecast to crest at 20.3 feet this afternoon and\nwill fall below flood stage by this afternoon.\n* At 20.0 feet...Water is over most local roads in the flood plain.\nBe safe...Turn Around and Do Not Drown.  Agricultural lands flood.\nWater covers Bedford Boat Club grounds.   Access to higher\ncampground spots at the Bedford Boat Club are blocked by high\nwater.",
