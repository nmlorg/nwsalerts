Surface temperatures will start off near\nor slightly below freezing before rising past midnight. Cold\nsurface temperatures may allow for brief slick spots to develop on\narea roadways and elevated surfaces before temperatures warm\nsufficiently in the predawn hours on Saturday morning.\n\nOnly light snow and ice accumulations are possible in these\nareas, but those traveling are urged to exercise caution late this\nevening into the early overnight hours. A transition to all rain\nby daybreak should allow for any slick spots to dissipate early\nSaturday morning.",
