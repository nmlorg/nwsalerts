The heaviest rainfall\nhas been over the slopes of South Hilo, Puna and Kau districts\nwith rainfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour. Additional heavy\nshowers are expected to continue through the evening and overnight\nhours. Streams and rivers remain high, and ponding of water\ncontinues in low-lying areas. Water levels in the Wailuku River\nremain elevated, and residents in upper Piihonua should be\nprepared to take immediate action if water levels rise further, or\nif a Flash Flood Warning is issued.\n\n* Locations in the advisory include but are not limited to...\nHilo, Naalehu, Paauilo, Waipio Valley, Orchidlands Estates, Hawi,\nPepeekeo, Keaau, Honokaa, Ookala, Hawaiian Paradise Park and Kawa\nFlats.",
        "instruction": "Stay away from streams, drainage ditches and low lying areas prone to\nflooding.\n\nRainfall and runoff will also cause hazardous driving conditions due\nto ponding, reduced visibility and poor braking action.\n\nDo not cross fast flowing or rising water in your vehicle, or on\nfoot. Turn around, don't drown.",
