Some roads in those areas, especially those\nthat are not heavily traveled, are likely to be slippery due to\nthe snow. Occasional light snow showers are expected through\nearly afternoon. Use extra caution if traveling in the mountains\ntoday. Drive slowly and leave plenty of space between vehicles.",
