        "description": "Areas of dense fog have have developed late this afternoon across\nthe coastal waters from the Palos Verdes peninsula southward to\nOrange county and inland across the San Pedro Channel to near\nCatalina Island. At 4 pm, Cabrillo Beach reported a visibility\nnear zero while Huntington Beach reported one-eighth mile.\nThe southern coastal waters will likely continue to experience\nvisibilities from one quarter mile to near zero at times through\nearly Saturday morning.\n\nMariners in harbor, especially those without radar, should\nconsider remaining in harbor until the dense fog improves.\nPoor visibilities can obscure vision of exposed rocks and other\nvessels, including large ships in the shipping lanes.",
