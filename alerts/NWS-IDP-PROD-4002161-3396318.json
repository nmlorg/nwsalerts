Chain controls\nare likely. The hazardous conditions will impact the Monday\nevening and Tuesday morning commutes.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strong winds could cause tree damage and\nlow visibility situations. Waves on Lake Tahoe are projected to\nreach 4 to 6 feet, especially near the east and northeast\nshores. Clearly this would be dangerous for boating.",

Leave extra space between vehicles since\nit takes longer to stop on slick roadways.\n\nThe latest road conditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.",
