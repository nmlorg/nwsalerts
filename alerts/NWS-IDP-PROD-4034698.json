        "description": "A cold front traveling south across Washington and Oregon will\ncontinue to bring snow to the Blue Mountains tonight. Snow will\ngradually taper off from north to south, ending late tonight into\nearly Sunday. Accumulations of 3 to 5 inches will be possible in\nthe Blue Mountains mainly above 3500 feet. Snowfall rates of one\nhalf to one inch per hour will cause snow to accumulate fast on\nthe roadways and significantly reduce visibilities, and snow has\nalready accumulated on portions of interstate 84 in these areas.\nThis will generate slick and hazardous travel in spots through\nSunday morning as freezing temperatures continue to spill into the\nregion behind the front.",
