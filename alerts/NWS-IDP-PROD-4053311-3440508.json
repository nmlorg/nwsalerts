        "description": "...HIGH SURF WARNING FOR NORTH AND WEST FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU\nKAUAI OAHU MOLOKAI...NORTH FACING SHORES OF MAUI...AND WEST\nFACING SHORES OF THE BIG ISLAND...\n\n.The combination of 2 large northwest to north-northwest swells,\nwill continue to produce large and dangerous surf along most\nnorth and west facing shores this morning. In addition, significant\nbeach erosion, overwash onto vulnerable low-lying coastal roadways,\nand surges within north and west facing harbors such as Haleiwa\nand Waianae will be possible this morning. The swells will begin\nto lower by late morning, with a steady decline expected this\nafternoon through tonight. Surf will likely remain at advisory\nlevels this afternoon along most north and west facing shores\nhowever, while the surf is expected to remain at warning levels\nalong west facing shores of the Big Island through the day.\n\n* WHAT...Surf will be 18 to 25 feet early this morning, lowering\nto 12 to 16 feet by late this afternoon, along north and west\nfacing shores of Niihau and Kauai, as well as north facing\nshores of Oahu, Molokai, and Maui. Surf will be 12 to 20 feet\nearly this morning, lowering to 8 to 12 feet by late this\nafternoon along west facing shores of Oahu and Molokai.\n\n* WHERE...North and west facing shores of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu,\nMolokai, and north facing shores of Maui.\n\n* WHEN...Until noon HST today.\n\n* IMPACTS...High. Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping\nacross portions of beaches, very strong breaking waves, and\nstrong longshore and rip currents. Breaking waves may\noccasionally impact harbors making navigating the harbor\nchannel dangerous.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of onshore winds, large\nsurf, and peak monthly tides could result in significant beach\nerosion, flooding of beaches that normally remain dry and\noverwash onto vulnerable low-lying coastal roads and other\ncoastal infrastructure.",
        "instruction": "Large, breaking surf, significant shorebreak, and dangerous\ncurrents make entering the water very hazardous.\n\nAnyone entering the water could face significant injury or death.",
