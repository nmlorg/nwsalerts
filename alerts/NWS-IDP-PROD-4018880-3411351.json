Periods of greatly\nreduced visibility can also be expected along the higher ridge\ntops either side of the Mississippi River through the afternoon,\nthough widespread blizzard conditions are not likely.\n\nIf traveling through the afternoon and early evening, especially\nover the ridge tops or across southern Minnesota and northern\nIowa, be prepared that driving will be difficult to even dangerous\nat times with very low visibility. Additionally, be aware that\nrapidly falling temperatures will allow any earlier wet roads to\nrefreeze quickly.\n\n* WHAT...Northwest winds gusting to 40 mph this afternoon,\nresulting in areas of blowing and drifting snow. Periodic\nwhiteout conditions could occur along ridge tops. Rapidly\nfalling temperatures expected this afternoon.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of northeast Iowa.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on hazardous road conditions and areas of\nblowing snow with significantly reduced visibility. Cold wind\nchills as low as 20 below zero tonight could cause frostbite\non exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.",
