The several inches of powdery snow\nthat fell overnight into this morning will easily be resuspended\nby fast moving vehicles on area highways. This can substantially\nreduce visibilities. Conditions should improve this afternoon and\nevening when the falling snow ends. Drivers are urged to leave\nplenty of extra space between vehicles and to use caution.",
