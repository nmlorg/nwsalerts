        "description": "A strong cold front moved through the region today pushing the\nrain east into the Atlantic and allowing much colder air to filter\nsoutheastward into the region. Gusty northwest winds along the\nhigher terrain of the Appalachians has resulted in the\ndevelopment of snow showers once again, mainly along the western\nslopes. Just like last Friday, this may result in minor\naccumulations of snow in some areas. As temperatures drop below\nfreezing through the remainder of the evening in areas of\nmountainous terrain west of the Blue Ridge, roads may become snow\ncovered and hazardous. In addition, residual water from earlier\nday rainfall may freeze resulting in an ice/snow mixture in spots\non these roads.\n\nNote that a brief moderate to heavy snow shower, even though\ntypically only lasting a few minutes, can quickly result in the\nroad being covered with a thin sheet of snow and ice. Roads can be\ncome slick and hazardous very quickly in these situations catching\nmotorists off guard. The severely reduced visibility within these\nsnow showers further adds to the hazardous road conditions.\n\nIf you plan to travel through the mountains tonight west of the\nBlue Ridge, but especially near and west of the West\nVirginia/Virginia line between Hot Springs, Covington, Blacksburg,\nand Wytheville and further westward locations, be prepared to\nencounter areas of winter driving conditions. The worst conditions\nare expected to occur between now and midnight.\n\nStay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio or Commercial Radio and\nTelevision for the latest weather information.",
