For the\nSmall Craft Advisory, from 1 AM to 10 AM PST Friday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Strong winds will cause hazardous seas which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "A Gale Warning means winds of 34 to 47 knots are imminent or\noccurring. Operating a vessel in gale conditions requires\nexperience and properly equipped vessels. It is highly\nrecommended that mariners without the proper experience seek safe\nharbor prior to the onset of gale conditions.\n\nA Small Craft Advisory means that wind speeds of 21 to 33 knots\nare expected to produce hazardous wave conditions to small craft.\nInexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller\nvessels should avoid navigating in these conditions.",
