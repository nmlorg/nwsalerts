Strong and gusty north\nwinds will gradually diminish and will turn more offshore\nthrough the rest of the overnight. Until then, waves of 10 to 14\nfeet, occasionally to 18 will result in a continued threat for\nlakeshore flooding.\n\n* WHERE...The shoreline areas of Cook and Lake Counties in\nIllinois and Lake County in Indiana.\n\n* WHEN...Through 6 AM. Waves will continue to gradually subside\nthrough the rest of the night.\n\n* IMPACTS...The winds and large battering waves combined with near\nrecord high lake levels will exacerbate already significant\nbeach and shoreline erosion sustained in the past several\nmonths. Flood prone paths and roads along the lake will be\nsusceptible to lengthy closures due to the expected long\nduration of high winds and waves. Heed any closures and stay\naway from the edge of the lake.",
