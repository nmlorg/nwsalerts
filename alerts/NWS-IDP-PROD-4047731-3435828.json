The\nheaviest snow will be Sunday morning, with snowfall rates of an\ninch per hour likely Sunday morning. In addition, northerly wind\ngusts of 25 to 30 mph will develop Sunday afternoon as the snow\ntapers off, and this could lead to drifting snow and reduced\nvisibility.\n\nThere is a winter weather advisory for Martin and Watonwan\ncounties where less snow is expected.\n\nThe winter storm watch means be prepared, hazardous winter\nweather is possible. The winter storm warning means please take\naction such as adjusting travel plans, or allowing extra time for\ntravel.
