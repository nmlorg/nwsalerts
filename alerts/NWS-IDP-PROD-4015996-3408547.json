        "description": "...Winter Storm To Impact The Area Today through Saturday...\n\n.Widespread accumulating snow and a wintry mix of snow, sleet and\nfreezing rain at times, will spread across the area from mid to late\nmorning through Saturday morning. Snow accumulations of 2 to 5\ninches are likely, along with ice accumulations of up to two\ntenths of an inch. Locally higher amounts of snow may occur in\nareas that remain in snow for longer durations and at higher\nsnowfall rates. There also may be a period of sleet accumulation.\nStrong southeast winds gusting up to 30 to 35 MPH this afternoon\nand evening when combined with the falling precipitation will\nfurther reduce visibilities and cause dangerous traveling\nconditions.\n\nBy Saturday morning, very strong northwest winds gusting to 40 to\n45 MPH will lead to blowing and drifting snow with greatly reduced\nvisibility. These winds will combine with falling temperatures to\nproduce wind chills down to 10 below zero to 20 below zero during\nthe evening hours Saturday.\n\n* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations of\n3 to 5 inches and ice accumulations of up to one tenth of an\ninch. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of north central and northwest Illinois.\n\n* WHEN...From noon Friday to 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing\nsnow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous\nconditions will impact the evening commute.",
