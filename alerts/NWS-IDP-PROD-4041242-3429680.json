An additional inch or two of rainfall is likely with\nthe risk of high rainfall rates as well.  This will lead to\nflooded roads, and streams and creeks rising out of their banks.\n\nHAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.\n\nSOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.\n\nIMPACT...Flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,\nhighways, streets and underpasses as well as other\ndrainage and low lying areas.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nClayton, Clarkesville, Cornelia, Baldwin, Demorest, Mount Airy,\nAlto, Mountain City, Tiger and Dillard.",
