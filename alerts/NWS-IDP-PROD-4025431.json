        "description": "Precipitation is expected to develop over the North Carolina\nmountains beginning this evening. Although temperatures will\ninitially be above freezing, allowing just rain to fall across\nmuch of the area, the falling precipitation is expected to cool\nthe atmosphere, with near-freezing temperatures expected to\ndevelop in locations along the Blue Ridge escarpment, from around\nBlack Mountain, to Mount Mitchell, to Spruce Pine and the Blowing\nRock area. This will result in spotty freezing rain and light ice\naccumulation in these areas, with any icing expected to remain\nmostly confined to elevated surfaces. Temperatures are expected to\nwarm above freezing by around sunrise, allowing precipitation to\nchange back to rain.",
