This will continue through\nearly in the evening, when winds are expected to start to weaken.\nBlowing and drifting snow is mainly affecting west to east\noriented roads and will cause reduced visibility, down to a mile\nor less at times.\n\nAbundant sunshine may heat pavement enough to melt the drifting\nsnow, which could then quickly refreeze and develop slick spots\non roads where air temperatures are below freezing.",
