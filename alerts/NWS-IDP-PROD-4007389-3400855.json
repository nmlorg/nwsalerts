The Wabash River was rising along the full length.  The\ncrest along the White River was near Ravenswood. The crest along the\nEast Fork White River was between Seymour and Rivervale. Flooding\nalong the lower portions of the White and Wabash River is likely to\ncontinue through the end of the month.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday which\nwill allow smaller rivers to continue to recede this week.\nAdditional heavy rainfall of 1 to 2 inches is possible this weekend\nwhich could exacerbate ongoing flooding.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Clinton.\n* until Saturday evening.\n* There have been no observations in the last 24 hours.\n* Flood stage is 18.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It is forecast to crest at 22.6 feet this afternoon and\nwill fall below flood stage by Saturday morning.\n* At 23.0 feet...Extensive lowland flooding in progress.
