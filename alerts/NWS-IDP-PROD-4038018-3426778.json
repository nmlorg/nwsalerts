Eight to 10\ninches of snowfall will occur across the mountain peaks and west\nfacing slopes while around 2 to 6 inches will fall in the high\nvalleys, eastern highlands and plains. Temperatures will stay\nbelow freezing today which will cause roadways to become icy and\nsnowpacked, including along the I-25 corridor from Santa Fe to\nRaton Pass as well as other mountain passes and I-40 from the east\nmountain communities to the Texas border.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow. Additional snow accumulations of 2 to 4\ninches with locally 6 inches. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.\n\n* WHERE...South Central Mountains, Eastern Lincoln County and\nSouthwest Chaves County.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 AM MST Wednesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of falling and blowing snow\nwill reduce visibility below 1 mile.",
