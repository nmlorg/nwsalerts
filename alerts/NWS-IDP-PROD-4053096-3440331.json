        "description": "* At 430 AM EST, widespread rainfall accumulations of 3-5 inches\non February 6th over the entire Catawba River watershed has caused\nhigh flows and elevated lake levels along the Catawba River\nreservoir chain. As the excess water is passed through each lake\nproject downstream, significant pool rises have occurred at the\nmiddle Catawba River lakes, especially at Mountain Island Lake,\nwhere the pool is above the full pool of 100.0 feet. This is\ncausing nuisance shoreline flooding and flooding of lake-access\nareas, docks, and residential yards. As water spills over Mountain\nIsland Dam, high flows are also causing rises and nuisance flooding\nof residential yards just downstream of the dam along the Catawba\nRiver.\n\n* Additional rainfall is expected tonight through Tuesday across the\nCatawba River watershed.  Rainfall totals of up to an inch are\nforecasted through Tuesday afternoon with additional rainfall\nexpected later this week.  The combined runoff from this rainfall\nwill result in additional flow that will need to be passed through\nthe Catawba reservoir system.  With the pool at Lake Norman near 99\nfeet, this additional water may require additional releases at\nCowans Ford Dam, which may result in additional rises and more\nsignificant flooding at Mountain Island Lake and the Catawba River\nimmediately downstream of the dam.\n\n* The following reservoir is experiencing Action/Advisory Stage\npool elevations:\n\nMountain Island Lake.\nCURRENT Pool Elevation: 101.71 feet and rising slowly.\n\nFORECAST: Duke Energy projects the pool may exceed 102 feet\nTuesday morning and potentially exceed 103.5 feet later this week if\nthe forecasted rainfall occurs.\n\nACTION/ADVISORY Stage: 101.5 feet.\nMINOR Flood Stage: 103.0 feet.\n\nIMPACTS: At 101.5 feet, Action/Advisory Stage. Nuisance flooding of\nlow-lying areas including residential yards, docks, and boat-launch\nareas is ongoing.  Flooding of residential yards downstream of\nMountain Island Dam along Riverhaven Dr, Hart Rd, Lake Dr, and\nRiverside Dr is beginning.\n\nAt 103.0 feet, Minor Flood Stage. Significant inundation of\nlow-lying areas is ongoing around Mountain Island Lake and downstream\nof the dam along/near Riverside Dr. Some outbuilding inundation may\nbegin.\n\n* Residents should take immediate actions to protect property\nadjacent to Mountain Island Lake and the Catawba River, closely\nmonitor lake levels for sudden changes, and follow guidance from\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Emergency Management. Drivers are encouraged\nto heed any barricades and avoid all flooded areas.\n\n* For more information on lake levels or dam releases, people are\nencouraged to visit http://lakes.duke-energy.com, call 1-800-829-\n5253, or download the Duke Energy Lake View mobile app.",
        "instruction": "Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nBe especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the\ndangers of flooding.\n\nIf heavy rainfall causes additional gate releases upstream, the\nAdvisory may be upgraded to a Flash Flood Warning. People in\nflood-prone areas, especially along the lakeshore and immediately\ndownstream of a dam, should prepare to move to higher ground quickly\nif a Flash Flood Warning is issued.",
