        "description": "...Flooding Potential Will Increase Today and Tuesday...\n\n.The Flood Watch has been expanded to include additional counties\nin north Mississippi, and Phillips County in east central\nArkansas. Showers and thunderstorms will continue to bring\nlocally heavy rainfall today, mainly along and south of the\nInterstate 40 corridor. These showers and thunderstorms will\ngradually shift southward along an advancing cold front this\nafternoon. This cold front will slow as it moves into central\nMississippi tonight. Periods of moderate to heavy rain will be\nlikely over north Mississippi tonight, along and north of the\nslowing cold front. By sunrise Tuesday, 3 to 5 inches of rainfall\nare expected over the watch area, with isolated amounts to 6\ninches possible south of an Oxford to Tupelo line. After a brief\nrespite Tuesday morning and early afternoon, additional showers\nand thunderstorms will move into north Mississippi late Tuesday\nafternoon. This rain will precede locally heavy rainfall along and\nsouth of the Interstate 40 corridor Wednesday, possibly\nnecessitating a future extension and northward expansion of the\nFlood Watch. In addition to anticipated lowland flooding over the\nwatch area, the threat of river flooding will increase\nsignificantly through midweek.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Memphis has expanded the\n\n* Flood Watch to include portions of East Arkansas, North\nMississippi, and West Tennessee, including the following\nareas, in East Arkansas, Phillips. In North Mississippi,\nAlcorn, Benton, Marshall, Tate, Tippah, and Tunica. In West\nTennessee, McNairy.\n\n* From 6 AM CST this morning through Tuesday afternoon.\n\n* Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches with locally higher amounts are\npossible over saturated soils.\n\n* Low-lying areas and areas adjacent to rivers may flood.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
