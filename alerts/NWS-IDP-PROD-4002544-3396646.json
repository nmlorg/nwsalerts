Breakers\nof 24 to 27 ft will be possible on west and northwest facing\nbeaches. A high tide of 7-8 ft is also contributing to localized\nflooding along low lying coastal areas. The tide and waves will\nsubside throughout the afternoon.\n\n* WHERE...Mendocino Coast County.\n\n* WHEN...Until 7 PM PST this evening.. .\n\n* IMPACTS...Large breaking waves will generate hazardous\nconditions on area beaches. This threat will be maximized on\nsteeply sloped beaches. Large breaking waves can cause injury,\nwash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats near\nshore. Local flooding along low lying roads areas along the near\ncoast.",
