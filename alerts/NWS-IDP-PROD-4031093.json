        "description": "A fast-moving and very strong storm system will move into the\nsoutheast Gulf of Alaska late Wednesday night and cross the\nPanhandle Thursday morning.\n\nImmediately along and south of the track of the storm, very strong\nsoutherly winds are expected, shifting abruptly to the west as the\nstorm passes. These winds may down trees and powerlines as well as\ncause damage to fragile infrastructure along the coast. Should the\nlow pass around the time of high tide, some coastal flooding is\npossible.\n\nJust to the north of the track of the storm, a period of very\nheavy snowfall is possible, followed by a rapid increase in the\nsoutherly winds.\n\nAt this time, the forecast calls for the strongest winds to be\nroughly along and south of a line from Sitka to Tenakee Springs to\nPoint Bishop with heavy snowfall possible north of this line\nincluding Juneau, Gustavus, and Hoonah. There are still some\nsignificant track and timing differences that could play a huge\nrole in the weather impacts across the region. People are advised\nto stay weather-aware and keep informed with the latest forecasts\nand potential watches, warnings, and advisories from the National\nWeather Service in Juneau.",
