In west central Washington, King, Lewis, Pierce,\nSnohomish, and Thurston.\n\n* Through Sunday morning\n\n* Several rounds of moderate to heavy rainfall into this\nweekend. Rivers are expected to rise, with some rivers\nreaching flood stage as early as this evening. Snow levels\nwill be around 6,000 to 8,000 feet through tonight. Heavy\nrainfall may also cause periods of minor urban flooding. The\nexact placement of heaviest rainfall this afternoon into\ntonight remains uncertain and will have a direct influence on\nthe magnitude and placement of flooding. Widespread minor to\nmoderate river flooding is most likely, but major flooding is\nalso possible. Rivers from King County northward are at\ngreatest risk of reaching moderate to major flood severity.",
