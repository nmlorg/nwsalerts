The quick-moving\nsystem will exit east of the Upper Great Lakes early Tuesday\nbringing an end to the system snow. However, colder air being\npulled in behind the system will support light to at times\nmoderate lake effect snow over the northwest wind snow belts\nTuesday into Wednesday.\n\nThose planning travel over the southeast half of Upper Michigan\nlate Monday into Monday night should expect snow-covered and\nslippery highways and lowered visibility in moderate to possibly\nheavy snow.",
