        "description": "Winter precipitation is likely to occur Tuesday night into\nWednesday across West Central Texas. Much colder air will invade\nthe area following a strong cold frontal passage on Tuesday. Rain\nis initially expected to develop Tuesday night, and then change to\nsnow overnight across the area north of a line from Sonora to San\nSaba. A mix of snow and sleet is expected in far southern and\nsoutheastern parts of West Central Texas.\n\nWith temperatures dropping below freezing, accumulating snowfall\nis likely to occur across central and northern parts of West\nCentral Texas. While accumulating snowfall is likely, forecast\nsnowfall amounts are uncertain at this time, and will depend on\nseveral factors with an incoming storm system. Any snow and sleet\naccumulations will make for hazardous road conditions for\nmotorists.\n\nWind chill values are expected to be in the teens late Tuesday\nnight and Wednesday morning, with brisk north winds.\n\nResidents across West Central Texas should continue to monitor\nthe latest forecasts and updates regarding this developing winter\nweather system.",
