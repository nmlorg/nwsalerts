        "description": "Cold air will be shifting south through British Columbia over the\nweekend. A weather system on Sunday will arrive as cold Fraser\noutflow develops. Precipitation should change to snow around\nWhatcom county and the San Juans on Sunday. Cold wind chill will\ndevelop and blowing snow with poor visibility will be possible\ninto early next week in the Bellingham area and San Juans.\n\nThe cold air will spread south through the rest of Western\nWashington Sunday night. The leading edge of this cold air is\ncalled a modified arctic front. It is not unusual for snow to fall\nwith this type of cold front as it moves south down the I-5\ncorridor. Snow amounts tend to be light with modified arctic\nfronts but falling temperatures can lead to icy roads after even\nlight snowfall.\n\nAnother area that can see enhanced snowfall during Fraser outflow\nis around Port Angeles and along the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Cold\nair picks up moisture as it crosses the northern inland waters and\nsnow falls in the northerly flow as it pushes into the north\nportion of the Olympics.\n\nAreas along the coast and across Southwest Washington will not\navoid the cold snap developing early next week. A weather system\nmoving into Oregon on Monday could affect southwest Washington.\n\nStay tuned to updated weather forecasts and prepare for potential\nwintry weather.",
