Total snow accumulations of 2 to 6\ninches.\n\n* WHERE...Curry County, Roosevelt County and Chaves County\nPlains.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 AM MST Wednesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on icy and snow covered road conditions. The\nhazardous conditions will impact the evening commute.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of falling and blowing snow\nwill reduce visibility below 1 mile.",
