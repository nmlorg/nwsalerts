Inexperienced mariners, especially those operating\nsmaller vessels should avoid navigating in these conditions.\n\nThis Small Craft Advisory means that waves are expected to be\nhazardous to small craft. Mariners should avoid shoaling areas.\nLong period swell can sharpen into large breaking waves in\nshoaling areas. It is not unusual for waves to break much farther\nfrom shoaling areas than is normally experienced. Remember,\nbreaking waves can easily capsize even larger vessels.\n\nInexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller\nvessels, should avoid navigating in hazardous conditions.",
