Locally higher\namounts of snow may occur in areas that remain in snow for longer\ndurations and at higher snowfall rates. There also may be a period\nof sleet accumulation. Strong southeast winds gusting up to 30 to\n35 MPH this afternoon and evening when combined with the falling\nprecipitation will further reduce visibilities and cause dangerous\ntraveling conditions.\n\nBy Saturday morning, very strong northwest winds gusting to 40 to\n45 MPH will lead to blowing and drifting snow with greatly\nreduced visibility. These winds will combine with falling\ntemperatures to produce wind chills down to 10 below zero to\n20 below zero during the evening hours Saturday.\n\n* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Total snow accumulations\nof 1 to 3 inches and ice accumulations of up to two tenths of\nan inch. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of northeast Missouri, southeast Iowa and\nwest central Illinois.\n\n* WHEN...From 9 AM Friday to 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous\nconditions will impact the evening commute.",
