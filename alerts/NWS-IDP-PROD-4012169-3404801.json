For the\nFreezing Spray Advisory, light accumulation of freezing spray\nexpected.\n\n* WHERE...Coastal waters from Merrimack River, MA to Stonington,\nME out to 25 NM, including Penobscot Bay.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, from noon Thursday to noon EST\nFriday. For the Freezing Spray Advisory, from 2 AM to 5 PM EST\nFriday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in freezing spray is hazardous.\nFreezing spray may render mechanical and electronic components\ninoperative. Ice accretion on decks and superstructures may\nresult in some loss of stability. Strong winds will cause\nhazardous seas which could capsize or damage vessels and\nreduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for accumulation of ice on their vessel\nand consider altering plans to avoid or mitigate these hazardous\nnavigating conditions.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
