Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Central, South Central and Southeast Kansas.\n\n* WHEN...From 5 PM Thursday to noon CST Friday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Slick roads, parking lots, and sidewalks are expected.\nEven a small amount of ice accumulation can create hazardous\nconditions and could impact the Thursday evening and Friday\nmorning commutes.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...In south central and southeast Kansas, snow\nfollowed by mixed precipitation is expected Thursday afternoon\nand early evening while freezing rain appears more likely later\nin the evening and overnight periods. In central Kansas, snow\nand/or sleet may persist longer before transitioning to a wintry\nmix. Therefore, the main concern at this time for southern areas\nwithin the advisory will be lighter snow amounts but greater ice\naccumulation (up to around two tenths of an inch) from freezing\nrain. Further north in central Kansas, lighter ice accumulation\nbut potentially a heavier snow/sleet accumulation will be the\nprimary concern.",
