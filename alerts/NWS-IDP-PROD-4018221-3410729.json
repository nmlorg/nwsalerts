Near whiteout conditions are\npossible in open and rural areas. Additional snowfall this morning\nwill range from a dusting to around an inch for most locations.\nSnow showers that impact the area could be briefly moderate to\nheavy. For tonight, strong winds and very cold temperatures will\ncreate wind chills of 15 to 25 below zero, with near 30 below zero\nvalues possible in the far northwest forecast area.\n\n* WHAT...Drizzle and snow expected. Additional snow accumulations\nof an inch or less. Total snow and sleet accumulations of 1 to\n3 inches and ice accumulations of a tenth to two tenths\npossible. Northwest winds gusting up to 45 mph from late this\nmorning through the afternoon.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of northeast Missouri, southeast Iowa and\nwest central Illinois.\n\n* WHEN...From 9 AM Friday to 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Difficult travel due to snow covered or icy roads.\nBlowing snow and significant reductions in visibilities are\npossible, mainly in open and rural areas.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...For locations that received ice\naccumulation, the heavy weight of the ice combined with strong\nwinds could bring down tree branches and lead to isolated power\noutages.",
