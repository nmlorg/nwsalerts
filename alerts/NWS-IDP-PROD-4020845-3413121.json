The Driftwood River near Edinburgh will be near\nbankfull, with a crest near flood stage Sunday morning.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers\nwill continue until about Wednesday, January 29.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is forecast through midday Thursday.\nThis will give area waterways several days to drain and return to\nnear normal levels.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River at Williams.\n* until this evening.\n* At 5:00 AM Sunday the stage was 8.2 feet.\n* Flood stage is 8.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by this\nmorning.\n* At 8.0 feet...Flood stage at Williams.
