The combination of the large surf, strong\nonshore winds, high astronomical tides, and elevated ocean water\nlevels will likely produce wave runup and localized coastal\nerosion along east facing shores during the next few days.\n\n* WHAT...Surf building to 10 to 15 feet today and holding through\nSaturday.\n\n* WHERE...East facing shores of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and\nBig Island.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM HST Saturday, though the elevated surf will\ncontinue through early next week..\n\n* IMPACTS...High. Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping across\nportions of beaches and select low lying roads, very strong\nbreaking waves, and strong longshore and rip currents. Breaking\nwaves may occasionally impact harbors making navigating the\nharbor channel dangerous.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of the large surf, strong\nonshore winds, high astronomical tides, and elevated ocean water\nlevels will likely produce wave runup and localized coastal erosion\nalong east facing shores during the next few days.",
