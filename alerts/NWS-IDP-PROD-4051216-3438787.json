In southeast Arkansas,\nArkansas, Bradley, Cleveland, Desha, Drew, Jefferson, and\nLincoln. In southwest Arkansas, Calhoun, Dallas, and Ouachita.\n\n* Through Tuesday afternoon\n\n* Showers and thunderstorms are anticipated over south and\nsoutheast sections today through Tuesday. One to two inches of\nrain can be expected through Tuesday in this area. With an\nalready saturated ground, flash flooding may occur where heavier\nrain falls.\n\n* Since vegetation is dormant, and not consuming much ground\nwater, runoff from heavy rain will be increased. This elevates\nthe concern for flash flooding. Also, rapid rises may occur on\ncreeks, small streams, and flashy rivers.",
