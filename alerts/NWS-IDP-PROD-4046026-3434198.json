This will bring much lighter precipitation, generally\n1 to 3 inches in the mountains and a quarter to a half an inch for\nthe lowlands. Snow levels will be lowering to near 2000 feet with\nthis storm so there will be little impact on the rivers.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Green River Near Auburn\n* From 12 AM Thursday until further notice.\n* At  8:45 AM Friday the flow was 7718 cfs.\n* Flood flow is 9000 cfs.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...the river will rise back above flood stage mid-day\ntoday and crest near 11800 cfs this afternoon. The river will then\nfall slowly through Tuesday.\n* Impact...At 10000 cfs, the Green River will flood low areas of the\nmiddle Green River valley with water over SE Green Valley Rd.  Some\nflooding is possible at a few low spots along the banks of the\nGreen River in Auburn, including near Issac Evans Park in lower\nMill Creek basin between Auburn and Kent due to backwater. A flow\nof 9000 cfs feet on the Green River corresponds to a phase 3 flood\nin the King County flood system.",
