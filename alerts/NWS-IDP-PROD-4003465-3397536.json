Rainfall rates have briefly decreased over the past hour\nbut the latest satellite imagery continues to show showers\nupstream of the area. Water levels across streams and rivers\ncontinue to remain high and residents in upper Piihonua should be\nprepared to take immediate action if water levels rise further, or\nif a Flash Flood Warning is issued.\n\n* Locations in the advisory include but are not limited to...\nHilo, Naalehu, Paauilo, Waipio Valley, Orchidlands Estates, Hawi,\nPepeekeo, Keaau, Honokaa, Ookala, Hawaiian Paradise Park and Kawa\nFlats.",

Turn around, don't drown.",
