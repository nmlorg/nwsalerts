An ash plume is tracking east-southeast from the Volcano.\nThis may lead to a trace or dusting of ashfall for False Pass and\nnearby areas over the next few hours.\n\nAsh is an eye and respiratory irritant and is abrasive. Those with\nrespiratory sensitivities should take extra precautions to minimize\nexposure. Protect electronics and cover air intakes if ashfall is\nexpected or confirmed. Remove ash from surfaces with water if\npossible to prevent excessive accumulation.",
