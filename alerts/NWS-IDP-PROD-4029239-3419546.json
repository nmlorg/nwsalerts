Expected rainfall of one and a half to three\ninches will cause sharp rises, and may be enough to cause\nflooding of small streams and rivers draining out of the Willapa\nHills.\n\n* The river with the greatest concern of flooding is the Grays\nRiver in Wahkiakum County since it responds quickly to excessive\nrainfall.",

Those living in areas prone to flooding\nshould be prepared to take action should flooding develop.\n\nLandslides and debris flows are possible during this flood event.\nPeople, structures and roads located below steep slopes, in\ncanyons and near the mouths of canyons may be at serious risk\nfrom rapidly moving landslides.",
