        "description": "Other than a few showers and flurries, snow has ended for the\nmost part across West Texas and Southeast New Mexico. There has\nbeen some melting occurring on the roads this afternoon, but as\nthe sun sets temperatures will fall quickly into the teens and\n20's. This will cause refreezing on roadways, especially ones that\nhaven't been treated. Areas of black ice could develop and make\nroads very slippery. In addition, freezing fog is possible across\nthe Permian Basin where the heaviest snow fell. If you encounter\nfog, visibilities may quickly drop. Use caution while driving\nthrough the morning hours and give yourself plenty of time to get\nto where you are going.",
