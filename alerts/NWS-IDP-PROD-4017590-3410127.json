Overnight, the freezing rain and sleet\nmay taper off to freezing drizzle. Total snow and sleet\naccumulations of 2 to 6 inches are likely, along with ice\naccumulations up to two tenths of an inch. Strong southeast\nwinds gusting up to 30 to 35 MPH through this evening when\ncombined with the falling precipitation will further reduce\nvisibilities and cause dangerous traveling conditions.\nBy Saturday morning, very strong northwest winds gusting to 40 to\n45 MPH will lead to blowing and drifting snow with greatly\nreduced visibility. These winds will combine with falling\ntemperatures to produce wind chills down to 10 below zero to 20\nbelow zero during the evening hours Saturday.\n\n* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Additional snow and sleet\naccumulation of around an inch. Total snow and sleet\naccumulations of 3 to 6 inches and ice accumulations of up to\none tenth of an inch.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of east central, northeast and southeast Iowa\nand northwest Illinois.\n\n* WHEN...From noon Friday to 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult.",
