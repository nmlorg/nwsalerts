        "description": "A quick moving area of low pressure will bring a wintry mix of\nrain, sleet, and patchy freezing rain to the region between 11pm\nand 2am, before a changeover to plain rain. Because temperatures\nhave radiated into the upper 20s to 30 degrees for many spots\nthis evening, patchy black ice on untreated surfaces is possible\nas well for at least the first half of the overnight.\n\nIf traveling overnight, proceed with extra caution as untreated\nsurfaces may be slippery. Temperatures should rise safely above\nfreezing late tonight, alleviating the icing threat.",
