        "description": "The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has extended\nthe\n\n* Flood Advisory for...\nHabersham County in northeastern Georgia...\nRabun County in northeastern Georgia...\n\n* Until 1015 AM EST Tuesday.\n\n* At 400 AM EST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated\npatches of moderate rainfall are returning to Rabun and Habersham\ncounties after a quieter past 6 hours, when less than a quarter\ninch of rainfall occurred.  The lighter rainfall allowed streams\nto crest, albeit over bankfull, following widespread storm-total\nrainfall of 1.75-2.25 inches since 7am Monday morning.  New rounds\nof moderate rainfall will induce new runoff which will likely\nkeep streams elevated and cause nuisance flooding of low-lying\nareas to persist.\n\n* Additional rainfall of 1-2 inches is possible early Tuesday\nmorning through Tuesday afternoon.  This will exacerbate ongoing\nflooding and may cause new flooding to develop.  This area may be\nupgraded to a Flash Flood Warning if additional heavy\nrainfall develops. Residents within low-lying areas, especially\nadjacent to streams, are encouraged to stay weather aware and have\na way to receive NWS warnings.  Drivers are urged to obey all\nbarricades and avoid flooded roadways.\n\n* The following streamgauge remains above Action/Advisory Stage:\nSoque River at GA 197 near Clarkesville.\n\nCURRENT Stage: 12.39 feet and falling slowly.\nCREST: 12.47 feet at 2:15am.\nFORECAST: The Soque River will continue to slowly fall over the\nnext several hours unless heavier rainfall develops. Additional\nrises are possible Tuesday morning.\n\nACTION/ADVISORY Stage: 11.0 feet.\nMINOR Flood Stage: 13.0 feet.\n\nIMPACTS: Between 11 and 13 feet, the Soque River will begin\nflooding low-lying areas adjacent to the river near Clarkesville,\nincluding Pitts City Park.\n\n* The headwaters of the Tallulah River also remain above bankfull, but\nthe river has crested and is slowly receding. Expect a slow recession\nor steady levels as additional light to moderate rainfall moves over\nthe watershed. Additional rises are possible through Tuesday morning.\n\n* Some locations that may experience flooding include...\nClayton, Clarkesville, Cornelia, Baldwin, Demorest, Mount Airy,\nAlto, Mountain City, Tiger and Dillard.",
        "instruction": "Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the\ndangers of flooding.\n\nIn hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are\npotentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded\nroads. Turn around, dont drown.\n\nIf additional heavy rainfall develops, the Advisory may be upgraded to\na Flash Flood Warning. People in flood prone areas, especially along\nsmall streams, should prepare to move to higher ground quickly if a\nFlash Flood Warning is issued.",
