Strong north\nto northeast winds gusting up to 40 to 50 mph will build waves\nto as high as 12 to 16 feet with occasional waves up to 20\nfeet.\n\n* WHERE...The shoreline areas of Cook and Lake Counties in\nIllinois and Lake and Porter Counties in Indiana.\n\n* WHEN...Late Friday night through late Saturday night.\n\n* IMPACTS...The winds and large battering waves combined with\nnear record high lake levels could exacerbate already\nsignificant beach and shoreline erosion sustained in the past\nseveral months. Vulnerable structures along the shore may be\nheavily damaged. In addition, flood prone paths and roads\nalong the lake will be susceptible to lengthy closures due to\nthe expected long duration of high winds and waves.",
