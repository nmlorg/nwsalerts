Steady rainfall is\nexpected to continue most of today. Minor flooding is likely to\ndevelop in the advisory area as ditches and culverts fill, and\nsmall streams leave their banks. Excessive ponding on roadways is\nlikely. Up to two inches of rain have fallen since yesterday\nevening, with another inch or two likely before rain tapers off.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nRock Hill, Union, Chester, Fort Mill, Tega Cay, Newport, Lesslie,\nGreat Falls, Monarch Mill and Buffalo.",
        "instruction": "Heavy rainfall will cause ponding of water in urban areas, highways,\nstreets and underpasses, as well as other poor drainage areas and low\nlying spots. Do not attempt to travel across flooded roads. Turn\naround, don't drown. Rapid rises on small creeks and streams also\npossibly will flood low water crossings and farmland.\n\nOnly when it is safe to do so, please report floodwaters or\nlandslides flowing over roads or threatening property to the National\nWeather Service by calling toll-free, 1, 800, 2 6 7, 8 1 0 1, by\nposting on our Facebook page, or via Twitter using hashtag NWSGSP.\nYour message should describe the event and the specific location\nwhere it occurred, including roadways, nearby cross streets, stream\nnames, and other landmarks.",
