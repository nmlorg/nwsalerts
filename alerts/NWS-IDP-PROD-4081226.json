        "description": "Melting of snow Saturday may have resulted in patchy areas of\nblack ice on untreated roads. This will be especially true\nfor the western mountains of North Carolina, parts of southwest\nVirginia, and southeast West Virginia where 1 to 3 inches of snow\nfell Friday night, with isolated snow totals in excess of 5\ninches across southeast West Virginia.\n\nTemperatures warmed just enough above freezing Saturday to permit\nsome of the snow to melt. This melt water then develops into\npatches of black ice at night when temperatures drop below\nfreezing.\n\nTemperatures are expected to warm above freezing by 1100 AM\nSunday morning.\n\nUse extra caution if you plan to travel through areas which\nreceived snow. Reduce speed, avoid sudden breaking, and allow\nextra distance between you and the vehicle in front of you.",
