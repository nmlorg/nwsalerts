As a result\nof excess water passing though each lake, the pool height at\nMountain Island Lake, which was already above the full pool value\nof 100 feet, has edged higher to 101.7 feet early this morning.\nThis will cause nuisance shoreline flooding of lake access areas,\ndocks, and residential yards along and downstream of the lake.\n\n* For Mountain Island Lake, at 101.5 feet, typical impacts include\nnuisance flooding of low-lying areas including residential yards,\ndocks, and boat-launch areas. Flooding of residential yards\ndownstream of Mountain Island Dam along Riverhaven Dr, Hart Rd,\nLake Dr, and Riverside Dr is occurring.\n\n* Residents should take immediate actions to protect property\nadjacent to Mountain Island Lake and the Catawba River, closely\nmonitor lake levels for sudden changes, and follow guidance from\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Emergency Management. Drivers are encouraged\nto heed any barricades and avoid all flooded areas.\n\n* For more information on lake levels or dam releases, people are\nencouraged to visit http://lakes.duke-energy.com, call 1-800-829-\n5253, or download the Duke Energy Lake View mobile app.",
