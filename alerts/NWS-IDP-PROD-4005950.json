        "description": "Freezing drizzle is likely to develop over northern IL this\nevening, and continue overnight. Because surface temperatures\nare expected to hover in the lower 30s, some minor ice\naccumulation is possible, especially for areas along and north of\nI-80. This could impact on the early Monday morning commute due\nto the possibility of slick road conditions. The freezing drizzle\nthreat will end by daybreak Monday, so travel conditions will\nrapidly improve during the morning.",
