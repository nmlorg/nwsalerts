        "description": "A winter storm system will potentially bring a light wintry mix\nto portions of southeast Missouri and southern Illinois Wednesday\nnight into Thursday morning. At this time, confidence is not\ngreat, but some minor ice and snow accumulations cannot be ruled\nout. Temperatures are likely to be right near freezing, so any\naccumulations will generally be limited to grass and elevated\nsurfaces. However, a few travel difficulties may develop on\nbridges and possibly in the higher terrain of southeast Missouri.\nTemperatures are expected to climb well above freezing by Noon\nThursday, so any impacts should be short-lived.",
