Strong north to northeast\nwinds frequently gusting to 40 to 50 mph have built waves to 14\nto 18 feet with occasional waves up to 23 feet.\n\n* WHERE...The shoreline areas of Cook and Lake Counties in\nIllinois and Lake County in Indiana.\n\n* WHEN...Highest waves through mid evening then gradually\nsubsiding.\n\n* IMPACTS...The winds and large battering waves combined with\nnear record high lake levels will exacerbate already\nsignificant beach and shoreline erosion sustained in the past\nseveral months. Vulnerable structures along the shore may be\nheavily damaged. In addition, flood prone paths and roads\nalong the lake will be susceptible to lengthy closures due to\nthe expected long duration of high winds and waves. Heed any\nclosures and stay away from the edge of the lake.",
