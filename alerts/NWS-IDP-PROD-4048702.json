        "description": "After above average warmth this weekend, significant changes to\nthe weather pattern will unfold Sunday night into Monday and\nTuesday. A cold front will quickly invade northeastern New Mexico\nSunday, advancing farther south and west into the state Sunday\nnight. In addition to the colder temperatures and gusty winds,\nprecipitation is also expected to develop Sunday night across much\nof central New Mexico. Precipitation in the form of rain and high\nelevation snow will continue Monday while expanding farther west\nthrough the day.\n\nWhile snow accumulations will generally be light through Monday,\nanother cold front will begin surging into New Mexico Monday night\nand Tuesday, helping snow to expand and intensify. Lower elevation\nareas can expect light to moderate snowfall accumulations while\nhigher mountain areas have the potential to pick upwards of a foot\nor more through Tuesday. The second surge of colder temperatures\nwill also send daytime temperatures 10 to 25 degrees below mid-\nFebruary averages with harsh wind chills.\n\nAnyone planning travel in New Mexico Sunday night through Tuesday\nshould be prepared for potential adverse weather conditions with\nstrong winds, snow-covered roads, and low visibility. Monitor NOAA\nweather radio, weather.gov/abq or your local media for the latest\nweather updates. For the latest New Mexico road conditions visit\nnmroads.com or call 5-1-1.",
