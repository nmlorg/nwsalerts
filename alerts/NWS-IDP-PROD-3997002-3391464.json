In addition, some\nof the rainfall may freeze up, and therefore not get into the river\nsystem.\n\nIf rainfall actually getting into the basin is less than predicted,\nthe forecast river stage may not be reached. Conversely, if rainfall\ngetting into the river basin is more than predicted the river may\ncrest higher.\n\nAs the forecast becomes more certain, this watch will either be\nupgraded to a warning or cancelled.\n\nThe Flood Watch continues for\nThe La Moine River at Colmar\n* Until Monday evening.\n* At  8:45 AM Friday the stage was 5.5 feet.\n* Flood stage is 20.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is possible.\n* Forecast, Rise above flood stage Sunday evening...and continue\nrising to 21.0 feet Monday morning. Fall below flood stage Monday\nevening.\n* This forecast is based on routed flow from upstream in combination\nwith forecast rainfall getting into the river. Consequently there\nis limited confidence in the river reaching flood stage.",
