        "description": "A strong cold front is expected to bring snow to portions of the\nBorderland on Wednesday morning with light snow possible for Las\nCruces, El Paso, and Alamogordo. Snowfall accumulations of a trace\nto under 1 inch look possible. Even these light amounts could be\nenough to bring some travel difficulties for the morning commute\nfor US-70 between Las Cruces and Alamogordo, I-10 between El Paso\nand Las Cruces, and for the El Paso metro area. Travel across San\nAndres Pass and Transmountain Pass could be particularly\ndifficult. Heaviest snowfall amounts Wednesday morning should\nremain just east of the El Paso metro area, over Hudspeth and\nOtero counties, and possibly far eastern El Paso county. These\nareas could see snow amounts of 1 to 3 inches, with a few\nlocations possibly reaching 5 inches. Continue to monitor the\nlatest forecast for any changes in snowfall totals and for the\npotential of any weather advisories as some uncertainty remains on\nhow much snow will fall for Las Cruces and El Paso as there will\nbe a sharp cut-off in the northern and western extent of snow.",
