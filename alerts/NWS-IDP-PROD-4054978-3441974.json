Rainfall totals of\none to one and a half inches can be expected, with isolated\nhigher amounts, especially across west Kentucky and extreme\nsoutheast Illinois.\n\n* The ground is saturated, so almost all of the rain will quickly\nrun off into streams and rivers. Water will continue to collect\nin low lying areas and will likely spread into areas that are\nnot normally prone to flooding. Low water crossings should be\navoided during this time.",
