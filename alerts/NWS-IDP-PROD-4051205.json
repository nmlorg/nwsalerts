        "description": "A cold front moved through the area last evening with colder air\ncontinuing to work into the region early this morning. Precipitation\nis expected to develop across the area before sunrise and\ncontinue through the day. Much of the precipitation will be light\nand as the latest model runs have been slightly warmer expect\nrain to be the primary form of precipitation today and tonight.\nCannot rule out a rain/freezing rain mix for Northern Lea County\nthis morning with a rain snow mix tonight for the same area.\n\nThe best chance of seeing winter weather across Southeast New\nMexico and the Northern Permian Basin appears to be Tuesday and\nTuesday night. Precipitation should begin as a rain/snow mix and\nthen change to all snow across the northern part of the area. A low\naccumulation of a snow is possible. Could even see a rain/snow\nmix extend to south of the Pecos River Tuesday night. This wintry\nweather may continue Wednesday morning. Anywhere wintry\nprecipitation occurs slick road conditions are possible... but by\nWednesday afternoon all precipitation should turn to rain before\nending from west to east.\n\nBe sure to monitor NOAA weather radio and visit our website at\nweather.gov/maf for the latest weather updates.",
