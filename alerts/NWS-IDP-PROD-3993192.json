        "description": "It is looking increasingly likely that Lower Michigan will see\nseveral rounds of heavy rain late this week and this weekend.\nRecent forecast trends suggest at least 2 inches of rain is\nlikely across virtually all of the Grand and Kalamazoo River\nbasins, as well as much of the Muskegon River basin.\n\nRivers are still high and recovering from the heavy rain that fell\nin late December, and soils remain saturated. This would lead to\nsignificantly rising rivers everywhere, and bring the risk of\nflooding to many of the rivers in West Michigan. There is\nstill significant uncertainty with whether or not some of this\nrain could fall as snow/sleet/freezing rain, which would make a\nbig difference on the effect this all has on river levels.\n\nPeople living in flood prone locations should monitor forecasts\nthis week on this developing hazardous weather situation. Now is\nthe time to think about preparedness and plan for impacts in the\nevent the heavy rainfall and flooding materialize.\n\nThe latest forecasts are always at www.weather.gov/grr",
