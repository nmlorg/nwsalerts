Heavy freezing spray at a rate of\n2 cm per hour or greater expected, and may rapidly accumulate\non vessels.\n\n* WHERE...Lake Superior west of a line from Saxon Harbor WI to\nGrand Portage MN beyond 5NM and Lake Superior from Saxon\nHarbor WI to Upper Entrance to Portage Canal MI 5NM off shore\nto the US/Canadian border including Isle Royale National Park.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, from 11 PM EST /10 PM CST/ this\nevening to 4 AM EST /3 AM CST/ Wednesday. For the Heavy\nFreezing Spray Warning, from 10 AM EST /9 AM CST/ Tuesday to 7\nAM EST /6 AM CST/ Wednesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of stability.\nStrong winds will cause hazardous waves which could capsize or\ndamage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
