Rainfall is likely to fall\nheavy at times beginning tonight leading to the potential for\nflooding and landslides in the mountains.\n\nThe Flash Flood Watch continues for\n\n* portions of northeast Georgia and western North Carolina,\nincluding the following areas, in northeast Georgia, Habersham\nand Rabun. In western North Carolina, Avery, Buncombe, Burke\nMountains, Caldwell Mountains, Graham, Haywood, Henderson,\nMacon, Madison, McDowell Mountains, Mitchell, Northern\nJackson, Polk Mountains, Rutherford Mountains, Southern\nJackson, Swain, Transylvania, and Yancey.\n\n* from 6 PM EST this evening through Thursday evening\n\n* The threat for heavy and/or excessive rainfall will be on the\nincrease tonight through Thursday.\n\n* Rapid rises on streams and creeks are likely to occur along\nwith the threat of flooded roads. Flooding is also likely to\noccur on larger rivers which would linger through Friday.\nStorm total rainfall through Thursday evening may be as much\nas 5 or 6 inches in favored locales across the Northeast\nGeorgia and Southern North Carolina Mountains.",
        "instruction": "Rainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been\nassociated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides.\nIf you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a\nmountain, especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance\nof the storm or as quickly as possible should rising water,\nmoving earth, or rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel along\nmountain roads during the period of heavy rainfall.\n\nA Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead\nto flash flooding. Flash flooding is a very dangerous situation.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action\nshould Flash Flood Warnings be issued.",
