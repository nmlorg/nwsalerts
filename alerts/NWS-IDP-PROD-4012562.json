        "description": "A period of heavy rainfall friday night into Saturday will cause\nrises on the rivers flowing off the Olympics. Total rainfall\nduring this time frame could be as high as 2 to 3 inches in the\nOlympics. This amount of rain will drive the Skokomish River up\nnear flood stage but is likely to stay just below. The snow level\nwill also be marginal for flooding as it will start very low but\nrise as high as 4000 feet by the end of the storm. Depending on\nthe rainfall total, high enough snow level, and potential melting\nof low elevation snow in the valleys, minor flooding is possible\non this river as a result.\n\nPlease continue to monitor the latest forecast for the next few\ndays. Details of potential flooding will change as the situation\nevolves.\n\nLatest river forecasts available at\nwater.weather.gov/ahps2/index.php?wfo=sew",
