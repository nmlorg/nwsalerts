Given the already wet conditions, and with stream\nlevels rising, the threat for additional heavy showers and a few\nthunderstorms will produce an additional inch or two of rainfall\nalong with the threat of high rainfall rates.  This will lead to\nflooded roads and cause streams and creeks to rise out of their\nbanks.\n\nHAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.\n\nSOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.\n\nIMPACT...Flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,\nhighways, streets and underpasses as well as other\ndrainage and low lying areas.",
