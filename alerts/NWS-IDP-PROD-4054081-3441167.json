This storm will start with snow Wednesday morning, but\nsurface temperatures will likely warm up just enough to convert\nthe precipitation type to rain by the late morning to early\nafternoon hours, with a mix of rain and snow through the afternoon.\nHowever, temperatures will crash back down Wednesday evening as a\nstrong cold front catchs up to the broad area of precipitation\nstill occurring across the region. This will result in sufficent\nsnowfall Wednesday night to warrent keeping the advisory going\nthrough midnight as the whole system moves east. Snowfall totals\nare low confidence owing to the above freezing temperatures\nexpected during the day Wednesday, but expect enough mixed wintry\nprecipitation to warrant going with a widespread winter advisory.\n\n* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3\ninches.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of east central and northeast Kansas and\ncentral, north central and west central Missouri.\n\n* WHEN...From 9 AM Wednesday to midnight CST Wednesday night.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous\nconditions could impact the evening commute.",
