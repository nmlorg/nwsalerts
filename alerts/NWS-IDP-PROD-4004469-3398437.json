Moderate flooding of agricultural lands\nmay result in livestock issues. Travel around Hanging Rock is\nimpacted. Road access near the river is cut off to residential\nhomes southeast of Chewey Bridge. Access to Winset Hollow is cut\noff. A few cabins in the Fidler's Bend area may have minor\nflooding. Extreme turbulence makes the river too hazardous for\nfloating.",
