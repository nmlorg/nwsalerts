As\ntemperatures continue to cool slightly through dawn, it is\npossible that rain could briefly mix with some snow. Snow\naccumulations should amount to a half an inch or less, and may be\nmore limited to grassy and elevated surfaces. There is also the\npotential for a few slick spots to develop on area roadways, so\nuse caution during the morning commute. The threat of any snow\nwill end by 9 am.",
