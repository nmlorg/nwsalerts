This includes the entrance to Charleston Harbor.\n\nAny sea fog that forms has the potential to become dense with\nvisibility dropping to 1 NM or less. This fog is expected to move\noff the northeast through 10 PM, however conditions will remain\nfavorable for more sea fog to form early Wednesday morning.\nMariners should remain alert for rapidly changing conditions.",

Make sure all navigational\nrunning lights are on.\n\nPlease relay any reports of sea fog to the Charleston or Tybee\nIsland Coast Guard stations and ask them to immediately forward\nyour report to the National Weather Service in Charleston.",
