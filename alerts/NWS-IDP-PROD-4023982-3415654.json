A trace to\njust over a tenth of an inch of ice is forecast as\nprecipitation transitions to freezing rain late Wednesday into\nThursday.... with locally higher amounts in the higher\nterrain.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS: Cold surface temperatures will allow the\nsnow/sleet and freezing rain to cause some slick spots on area\nroadways, especially elevated surfaces such as bridges and\noverpasses.
