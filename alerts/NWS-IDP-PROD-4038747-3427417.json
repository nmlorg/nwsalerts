Flood Watch Tonight through Friday Morning...\n\n.As a cold front slowly moves over the Mid-Atlantic today and\nThursday, an extended period of rain showers will bring two to\nfour inches of rain to the area.

In southwest\nVirginia, Carroll, Floyd, Grayson, and Patrick.\n\n* From late tonight through Friday morning\n\n* An extended period of rainfall with high rainfall rates and\nthunderstorms on Thursday create favorable conditions for\nflooding.\n\n* The ground will be saturated when thunderstorms are most likely.\nHigh rainfall rates inside of these storms could potentially\ncreate rapid water rises, especially in small creeks and\nstreams, areas with poor drainage, and low lying areas.",
