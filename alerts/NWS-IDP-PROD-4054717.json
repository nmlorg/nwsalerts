This band of heavier snow was moving\nsouth at around 35 mph.\n\nSnowfall rates around one inch per hour are expected with this band\nof snow along with visibility to 1/2 mile less for a period as the\nband moves through. Gusty north winds at 25 to 35 mph are also\nexpected as the snow moves through, creating additional visibility\nreductions in blowing and drifting.\n\nThis band will continue south and affect areas  from Fairfield to\nGreat Falls to Stanford between 11 pm and midnight.\n\nVisibilities will drop quickly to less than half a mile in these\nareas of heavy snow.\n\nConditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be\nprepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra\ntime when traveling.",
