In Southeast Missouri, Dunklin and\nPemiscot.\n\n* Through Saturday morning.\n\n* Over 2 inches of rain is possible through Saturday morning.\n\n* Thunderstorms will become widespread as a storm system arrives\nfrom the southern Plains later tonight. Initially, storms may\nsit for several hours Northeast Arkansas and the Missouri\nBootheel this evening before finally pushing east. Torrential\ndownpours will possible with the storms. Since vegetation is\ndormant, and not consuming much ground water, runoff from\nheavy rain will be increased. This elevates the concern for\nflash flooding.
