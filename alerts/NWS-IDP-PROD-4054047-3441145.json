        "description": "The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has extended\nthe\n\n* Flood Advisory for...\nWest central Mecklenburg County in the Piedmont of North\nCarolina...\nSoutheastern Gaston County in the Piedmont of North Carolina...\n\n* Until 415 AM EST Wednesday.\n\n* At 358 PM EST, High flows and elevated lake levels continued along\nthe Catawba River reservoir chain. As a result of excess water\npassed though each lake, the pool height at Mountain Island Lake\nremained above full pool. This was causing nuisance shoreline\nflooding and flooding of lake-access areas, docks, and residential\nyards. High flows are also causing rises and nuisance flooding of\nresidential yards just downstream of the dam along the Catawba\nRiver.\n\n* For Mountain Island Lake, at 101.5 feet, typical impacts include\nnuisance flooding of low-lying areas including residential yards,\ndocks, and boat-launch areas.  Flooding of residential yards\ndownstream of Mountain Island Dam along Riverhaven Dr, Hart Rd,\nLake Dr, and Riverside Dr is occurring.\n\n* Residents should take immediate actions to protect property\nadjacent to Mountain Island Lake and the Catawba River, closely\nmonitor lake levels for sudden changes, and follow guidance from\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Emergency Management. Drivers are encouraged\nto heed any barricades and avoid all flooded areas.\n\n* For more information on lake levels or dam releases, people are\nencouraged to visit http://lakes.duke-energy.com, call 1-800-829-\n5253, or download the Duke Energy Lake View mobile app.",
