        "description": "Rises continue to be observed on the Missouri River in the Hoge\nIsland area early this evening from ice effects. With the arrival\nof warmer air this afternoon, and milder conditions forecast for\nWednesday, ice will likely start to erode in the Square Butte\nCreek, Ponderosa and Hoge Island areas over the next 12 to 24\nhours. This will cause an eventual decrease in water levels.\n\nThose with interests along the Missouri River should continue to\npay close attention to river conditions, as cycles of ice\nformation and ice loss will continue to cause fluctuating water\nlevels over the coming days.",
