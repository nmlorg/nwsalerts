Therefore, the Flash Flood Warning has been allowed to\nexpire and is replaced with a Flood Warning.\n\n* Please obey all barricades and do not drive over flooded roads.\nBarricades are in place for your safety and remain in place to\nallow engineers to assess road stability before determining they\nare safe for travel.\n\n* Mud Creek has crested and is now receding.  It will take several\nhours for the stream to fully recede so flooding of low-lying\nareas along Mud Creek near Hendersonville will continue through\nThursday evening.\n\n* Some locations that may continue to experience flooding include...\nHendersonville, Mills River, Fletcher, Flat Rock, Etowah, Mountain\nHome, Laurel Park, and Bat Cave.",
        "instruction": "Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Do not attempt to cross\nwater-covered roadways, bridges, or low-level crossings. Only a few\ninches of rapidly flowing water can carry away your vehicle. It is\nnot worth the risk. Please TURN AROUND, DON'T DROWN.\n\nNumerous roads, parking lots and bridges will be threatened by heavy\nrain and rapidly rising streams and creeks. Please pay close\nattention to road signs indicating a flood-prone area. Obey all\nbarricades, even if water is not currently over the road. Barricades\nare in place for your protection and indicate areas where flooding\ncan occur rapidly and without warning.",
