There continues to be accidents\ntonight, cars in ditches, and people sliding through\nintersections.\n\nIf you are traveling late tonight, be aware of these conditions.\nYou might need to reduce your speed and be careful near\nintersections that might be icy. Do not corner quickly.\n\nConditions will be slow to improve overnight given the big drop in\ntemperatures and flash freeze.",
