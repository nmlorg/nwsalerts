        "description": "...Winter Storm Continues into Saturday...\n\n.Snow has transitioned to a wintry mix of freezing rain and\nsleet across much of eastern Iowa and west central Illinois.\nThis transition will continue to move across northwest Illinois\nthe rest of the evening. Overnight, the freezing rain and sleet\nmay taper off to freezing drizzle. Total snow and sleet\naccumulations of 2 to 6 inches are likely, along with ice\naccumulations up to two tenths of an inch. Strong southeast\nwinds gusting up to 30 to 35 MPH through this evening when\ncombined with the falling precipitation will further reduce\nvisibilities and cause dangerous traveling conditions.\nBy Saturday morning, very strong northwest winds gusting to 40 to\n45 MPH will lead to blowing and drifting snow with greatly\nreduced visibility. These winds will combine with falling\ntemperatures to produce wind chills down to 10 below zero to 20\nbelow zero during the evening hours Saturday.\n\n* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Additional snow and sleet\naccumulations of up to 2 inches. Total accumulations of 3 to 5\ninches and ice accumulations of up to one tenth of an inch.\nWinds gusting as high as 45 mph will produce greatly reduced\nvisibility at times.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of north central and northwest Illinois.\n\n* WHEN...From noon Friday to 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing snow\ncould significantly reduce visibility.",
