Heavy snow will\nbe followed by rain and could drive the Skokomish River up near\nflood stage. The snow level will start near sea level Friday night\nand then rise as high as 4000 feet by the end of the storm.\nDepending on the rainfall total, increase in snow level, and\npotential melting of low elevation snow in the valleys, minor\nflooding is possible on the Skokomish as a result.\n\nPlease continue to monitor the latest forecast for the next few\ndays. Details of potential flooding will change as the situation\nevolves.\n\nLatest river forecasts available at\nwater.weather.gov/ahps2/index.php?wfo=sew",
