As swells build, expect\nbreaking wave heights of 15 to 20 feet.\n\n* WHAT...Increased risk of sneaker waves, rip currents, and large\nshore break are expected.\n\n* WHERE...Coastal North Bay Including Point Reyes National\nSeashore, Southern Monterey Bay and Big Sur Coast, San\nFrancisco Peninsula Coast, San Francisco and Northern Monterey\nBay Counties.\n\n* WHEN...Through 11 AM PST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS... Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to\nsea. Sneaker waves can knock unsuspecting beach goers over and\ninto the sea.",

Rock jetties can be deadly in such\nconditions, stay off the rocks.\n\nIf caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don't swim against\nthe current. If able, swim in a direction following the\nshoreline. If unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave\nfor help.",
