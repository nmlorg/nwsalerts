Although amounts will\nbe very light, this could result in light ice accumulations,\nmainly on elevated surfaces and potentially on bridges.\nTemperatures will rise above freezing by noon.\n\nWidespread hazardous travel is not expected. However, motorists\nshould remain alert, especially on bridges where slippery spots\noften develop first.",
