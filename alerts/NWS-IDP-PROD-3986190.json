        "description": "ESFAFC\n\nAs of Friday morning water is still reported to be flowing over\nthe Deneki Road as a result of a freeze up ice jam on Willow Creek\nupstream of the Deneki Road bridge. The initial ice jam and rapid\nrise in water levels at the Deneki Bridge occurred on December\n21st. The ice jam forced water into the floodplain on both the\nNorth and South sides of the river. Water levels have fluctuated\nover the last two weeks and are expected to continue to fluctuate\nas the river continues the normal freeze-up process.\n\nThe ice jam is not expected to release until spring break-up.\nOnce the river upstream forms an ice cover water levels are\nexpected to decrease, but the ice jam rubble will remain in place\nupstream of the bridge. Areas of standing water will likely freeze\nwith forecast cold temperatures over the next one to two weeks.\n\nThe Matanuska Borough has been responding to the flooding on\nWillow Creek and maintains a website for updated information on\nroad conditions and access. Please check this website for current\nupdates on the conditions near Deneki Road:\nhttps://www.matsugov.us/spotlights/willow-creke-flooding-2019\n\nThe Borough has also been posting updates to their Facebook page:\nhttps://www.matsugov.us/spotlights/willow-creke-flooding-2019",
