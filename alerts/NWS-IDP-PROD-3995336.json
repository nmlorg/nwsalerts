        "description": "A band of heavier snow showers will move across western Nevada\ninto the early afternoon hours.\n\nAreas from Reno to Fernley to Fallon and south to Carson City,\nVirginia City, and Yerington have the best chances of seeing a\nquick light accumulation through 1 PM today. This includes\nInterstate 80 east of Reno, Highway 580 in Washoe Valley, and\nHighway 50 east of Carson City to Fallon. Accumulations will range\nfrom a dusting up to a quick half inch in these areas. We can't\nrule out spots of near one inch snowfall mainly on non-paved\nsurfaces.\n\nExpect sudden changes in weather and road conditions into the\nearly afternoon. Some light accumulation is possible on untreated\nroadways and bridges. Check road status and traffic before\nheading out and allow some extra time for travel.",
