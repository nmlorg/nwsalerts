Swells will\nincrease on Wednesday and will cause very large breakers.\n\n* WHERE...Coastline from Sonoma County southward through\nMonterey County.\n\n* WHEN...From 1 PM PST Tuesday through 9 AM PST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Large breaking waves will generate hazardous\nconditions on area beaches. This threat will be maximized on\nsteeply sloped beaches. Rip currents can pull swimmers and\nsurfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,\nwash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats\nnear shore.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Swell heights 6 to 9 feet at 22 to 24\nseconds are expected late this afternoon to tomorrow morning.\nSwells will then build to 11 to 14 feet at 20 to 22 seconds\nWednesday. This will generate breaking waves of 20 to 25 feet,\nfavored locations may exceed 25 feet.",
