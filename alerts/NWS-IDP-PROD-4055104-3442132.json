Any residual\nmoisture left on roadways may freeze and create icy conditions as\nwell.\n\n* WHAT...Very cold wind chills as low as 25 below zero.\n\n* WHERE...Taylor, Clark, Buffalo, Trempealeau and Jackson\nCounties.\n\n* WHEN...From 4 AM to 10 AM Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...The cold wind chills could cause frostbite on\nexposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.",
