        "description": "Favorable conditions exist for river ice and the development of\npossible ice jams for the following rivers and their\ntributaries...Rock, Fox, DuPage, Des Plaines, and Kankakee. This\nrisk will continue through late this week.\n\nDue to expected very cold weather through early this week,\nconditions will be favorable for rapid river ice formation across\nthe area. Ice jams will also be possible, with the highest risk\nalong the Rock River, Fox River, and lower Kankakee River. Ice\njams may cause rises on area rivers with little warning.\n\nThis outlook means that elevated river levels and potential\nimpacts are possible, but the timing, extent, and severity remain\nuncertain. Persons with interests along area rivers should closely\nmonitor the latest forecasts.",
