        "description": "Patchy dense fog is possible across portions of southern\nConnecticut early this morning due to a combination of wet ground\nfrom last night's rainfall and light winds. In addition,\ntemperatures have fallen to around freezing, causing some\nuntreated surfaces with residual moisture from the rain and/or\nfog to become slippery. Visibilities may vary rapidly over short\ndistances and could fall to one quarter mile or less at times. If\ndriving, slow down, use your low beam headlights, and leave plenty\nof distance in front of you.",
