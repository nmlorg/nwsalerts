        "description": "Temperatures across the Interior are expected to fall sharply\ninto the 20s to 40s below this week.\n\nCold air will push southeast across the Interior beginning early\nMonday, reaching the southeastern Interior Tuesday.\n\n20s to 30s below are expected across the middle and upper Tanana\nValley. Typical cold spots could see 40s below or colder. Farther\nnorth across the Yukon Flats and southern Brooks Range, expect\nwidespread 30s to 40s below.\n\nModels show a considerable spread in temperatures later in the\nweek, so there is fairly low confidence in the long term forecast.\nFor now we expect cold temperatures to linger throughout the\nweek.\n\nResidents should prepare for cold temperatures, especially if\ntraveling, by keeping cold weather gear available at all times.\n\nFor the latest forecasts go to www.weather.gov/afg",
