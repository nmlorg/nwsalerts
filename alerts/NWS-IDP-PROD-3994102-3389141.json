Flooding will\nend on all rivers tonight except for the Skokomish and lower\nChehalis Rivers. More precipitation in on tap for Friday into\nSaturday of 1 to 2.5 inches. However, the snow level over the\nCascades will be too low for storm runoff to cause any flooding.\nOver the Olympics, the snow level could reach 3000 to 4000 feet and\ncould be enough to stall the Skokomish River from falling below\nflood stage or send it back up above flood stage if it is below by\nthen.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Chehalis River At Porter\n* Until Friday afternoon.\n* At  3:45 PM Wednesday the stage was 48.8 feet.\n* Flood stage is 48.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...The river is beginning to crest now at around 48.9 feet\nand then will fall to below flood stage Friday morning.\n* Impact...At 48.0 feet, the Chehalis River in Grays Harbor will flood\nlow pasture lands and some roads. High tidal levels at Aberdeen\nwill worsen flooding along the lower reaches.",
