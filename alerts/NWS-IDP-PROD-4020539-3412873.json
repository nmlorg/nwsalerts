        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nEast Fork White River...Eel River...Wabash River...White River...\n\n\n.Minor to moderate flooding continued Sunday morning in central and\nsouthern Indiana on the major rivers.  Crests will be/are comparable\nto those that occurred in February and June of 2019.  Minor\nflooding developed late Saturday afternoon on the Eel River that\nwill come to an end this afternoon.\n\nA mix of precipitation Friday and Saturday totaled as high as\napproximately 1.50 inches, which will slow river falls or bring\nlower secondary crests on the major rivers, and produce additional\nminor flooding on smaller ones.  Flooding has returned to Seymour on\nthe East Fork White River, and this afternoon it will return to\nSpencer on the White River.  The Driftwood River near Edinburgh will\nbe near bankfull, with a crest near flood stage Sunday morning.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers will\ncontinue until about Wednesday, January 29.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is forecast through midday Thursday.  This\nwill give area waterways several days to drain and return to near\nnormal levels.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River at Shoals.\n* until late tonight.\n* At 9:30 AM Sunday the stage was 20.7 feet.\n* Flood stage is 20.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by this\nafternoon.\n* At 20.0 feet...Significant flooding of agricultural lands begins.\nLivestock in low bottoms must be moved to higher ground.  Cemetery\nroad, East River road, and State Road 550 near Hindostan Church,\nand State Road 257 south of Washington begins to flood.  Water on\nDubois CR 725 North in March 2011.  Water receded from SR 550\nduring March 2011 on the south side of the river in the Loogootee\narea.",
