        "description": "An approaching storm will bring widespread rain to Middle\nTennessee beginning Sunday night and continuing into at least\nWednesday.\n\nHeavy rain is possible...though not certain...on Monday and\nTuesday. Much of the region should receive at least 1 to 2\ninches of rain. However, there is potential for an area of 3 to 5\ninches to occur. The most likely location for this to happen is\nacross the southern counties of Middle Tennessee but this could\nchange in the next two days.\n\nMost of the mid state had well above average rainfall over the\npast 2 months. If very heavy rain occurs Monday into Wednesday,\nflooding may occur along rivers, creeks, roads and low lying\nareas.\n\nMiddle Tennessee residents should monitor the latest forecasts\nconcerning the potential for heavy rainfall and flooding over the\nnext few days.
