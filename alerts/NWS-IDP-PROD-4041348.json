        "description": "Multiple periods of rainfall since the first of January have\nincreased soil moisture to high levels across Western Washington.\nRainfall amounts have been generally in the 1 to 3 inch range\nover the last 24 hours with locally higher amounts of 3 to 5\ninches for portions of the Cascades. An additional 0.5 to 1.5\ninches of rainfall is expected through Friday with locally higher\namounts possible in the mountains. This amount of rain will put\nextra pressure on soil instability, leading to an increased threat\nof landslides being triggered through the period and immediately\nafter.\n\nAreas above 5000 feet in elevation will see mostly snow and not be\naffected.\n\nA landslide has already been reported in Clallam County in western\nWashington near Beaver. More landslides are possible.\n\nFor more information about current conditions, visit\nwww.weather.gov/seattle, select Hydrology, and then scroll down\nfor the links to the landslide information pages.\n\nFor more information on landslides, visit the website for the\nWashington State Department of Natural Resources landslide\ngeologic hazards at: http://bit.ly/2mtA3wn",
