Flood Watch Tonight through Friday Morning...\n\nThe National Weather Service in Blacksburg has expanded the\n\n* Flood Watch to include portions of North Carolina and\nVirginia, including the following areas, in North Carolina,\nCaswell, Rockingham, Stokes, and Yadkin. In Virginia, Amherst,\nAppomattox, Bedford, Buckingham, Campbell, Charlotte,\nFranklin, Halifax, Henry, and Pittsylvania.\n\n* From late tonight through Friday morning\n\n* An extended period of rainfall with high rainfall rates and\nthunderstorms on Thursday will create favorable conditions for\nflooding. Rainfall totals of 3 to 4 inches are expected with\nlocally higher amounts possible.\n\n* The ground will be saturated when thunderstorms are most\nlikely. High rainfall rates inside of these storms could\npotentially create rapid water rises, especially in small\ncreeks and streams, areas with poor drainage, and low lying\nareas.",
