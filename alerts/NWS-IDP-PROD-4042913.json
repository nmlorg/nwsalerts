        "description": "As much colder air rushes in across the area behind a strong\nstorm system, scattered rain showers may mix with or change to\nsnow showers before ending late tonight through early Friday\nmorning.\n\nThere is the chance to see some snow accumulations but mainly\nconfined to the highest elevations of the north Georgia mountains,\nfrom near Amicalola Falls State Park up to the Georgia and North\nCarolina state line near Hiawassee. In these areas, a dusting to\n1/2 inch of snow is possible, with locally higher amounts around 1\ninch over the highest ridgetops.\n\nElsewhere across far north Georgia, a few snow flurries or snow\nshowers may mix with light rain showers late tonight into early\nFriday morning. No snow accumulations or impacts are expected as\nmorning low temperatures remain above freezing, in the mid to\nupper 30s.",
