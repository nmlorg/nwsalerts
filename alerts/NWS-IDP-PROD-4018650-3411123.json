        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nEast Fork White River...Wabash River...White River...\n\n\n.Minor to moderate flooding continued Saturday morning in\ncentral and southern Indiana on the major rivers. Crests will be/are\ncomparable to those that occurred in February and June of 2019.\n\nMixed precipitation yesterday and today has totaled up to about\n1.50 inches, which will slow river falls or bring lower secondary\ncrests.  Flooding may recur at Seymour on the East Fork White River\nand Spencer on the White River.\n\nThe main crest on the Wabash River has backtracked to Hutsonville\nfrom Riverton.  The river was cresting at Riverton on Friday, but\nnow with the additional precipitation runoff the crest will be\ndelayed until Sunday afternoon.  Vincennes will crest at 20.8\nfeet Monday afternoon.  Mount Carmel will crest Monday at 28.0\nfeet.  The White River is cresting at Petersburg and Hazleton.\nThe crest on the East Fork White is now downstream of Shoals.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers\nwill continue until the last few days of the month.\n\nOur next precipitation event is forecast to come Friday, thus we\nwill have 5 plus days of dry weather allowing drainage of area\nwaterways.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River at Edwardsport.\n* until Saturday January 25.\n* At 7:00 AM Saturday the stage was 22.0 feet.\n* Flood stage is 15.0 feet.\n* Moderate flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by\nSaturday January 25.\n* At 22.9 feet...A 25 foot section of Levee Unit 8 failed at this\nlevel on March 6 2011...flooding local roads behind the  levee.\nFlooding not nearly as bad as June 2008 levee failure.  Flooding\nwas very close to one of the June 2008 failures.",
        "instruction": "Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...\n\nMotorists should never drive into flood water. Turn around and go\nanother way. Keep children away from flooded areas. Recreational and\nagricultural interests should remain alert to changing river\nconditions.\n\nFor detailed flood information go to weather.gov/ind on the web and\nclick on rivers and lakes.",
