The core of heaviest precipitation occurred\nwithin 50 miles north and south of Interstate 70 across the state.\nThe bulk of the water will show up in the White River south of\nIndianapolis, where crests are expected to be up to about 5 feet\nabove flood stage.  Flooding along the lower reaches of the Wabash\nand White Rivers currently are predicted to last until the end of\nnext week.\n\nThe latest forecast model data is now predicting flood crests along\nthe White River to be lower than what was predicted Monday morning.\nThis will give us crests lower than what we saw in January.\nPredictions for the Wabash are very similiar to Monday's\npredictions.\n\nFlood impacts should mainly be confined to roads near the waterways,\nagricultural land, bottomlands, and levees.  Please see the specific\nimpacts listed for your location of interest below or by going to\nthe web page described below.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Lafayette.\n* from this evening to late Saturday night.\n* At 11:30 AM Tuesday the stage was 9.2 feet.\n* Flood stage is 11.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...Rise above flood stage by this evening and continue to\nrise to near 12.0 feet by Wednesday afternoon.  It will fall below\nflood stage by Saturday afternoon.\n* At 12.0 feet...High water affects a few low river cabins and county\nroads.",
        "instruction": "Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...\n\nMotorists should never drive into flood water. Turn around and go\nanother way. Keep children away from flooded areas. Recreational and\nagricultural interests should remain alert to changing river\nconditions.\n\nFor detailed flood information go to weather.gov/ind on the web and\nclick on rivers and lakes.",
