Crests will be/are\ncomparable to those that occurred in February and June of 2019. On\nthe Eel and Mississinewa, minor flooding has developed.\n\nMixed precipitation yesterday and today has totaled up to about\n1.50 inches, which will slow river falls or bring lower secondary\ncrests on the major rivers, and produce additional minor flooding on\nsmaller ones. Flooding may recur at Seymour on the East Fork White\nRiver and Spencer on the White River.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers\nwill continue until the last few days of the month.\n\nOur next precipitation event in the forecast does not arrive until\nFriday, thus we will have several dry days to allow for drainage of\narea waterways.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River at Hazleton.\n* until further notice.\n* There have been no observations in the last 24 hours.\n* Flood stage is 16.0 feet.\n* Moderate flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It is forecast to crest at 25.5 feet late tonight.\n* At 26.0 feet...People in residential cabins on the riverward side of\nthe levee generally relocate.  Many local roads are completely\nimpassable.  Oil fields are inaccessible.  The remaining water\npumps are installed on the west end of Hazleton.",
