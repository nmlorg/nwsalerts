        "description": "* WHAT...For the Gale Warning, northwest winds 20 to 25 kt with\ngusts up to 40 kt and waves 7 to 10 feet expected. For the\nHeavy Freezing Spray Warning, heavy freezing spray at a rate\nof 2 cm per hour or greater expected, and may rapidly\naccumulate on vessels. For the Small Craft Advisory, southwest\nwinds 15 to 25 kt with gusts up to 30 kt and waves 6 to 9 feet\noccurring.\n\n* WHERE...Black River to Ontonagon MI and Ontonagon to Upper\nEntrance of Portage Canal MI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, from 7 AM EST /6 AM CST/ Tuesday\nto 4 AM EST /3 AM CST/ Wednesday. For the Heavy Freezing Spray\nWarning, from 10 AM EST /9 AM CST/ Tuesday to 7 AM EST /6 AM\nCST/ Wednesday. For the Small Craft Advisory, until 7 AM EST\n/6 AM CST/ Tuesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of stability.\nStrong winds will cause hazardous waves which could capsize or\ndamage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
