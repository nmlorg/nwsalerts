        "instruction": "A Winter Weather Advisory for snow means that periods of\naccumulating snow will primarily cause travel difficulties. Roads\nmay rapidly become slippery once the snow begins, so motorists\nshould plan for a slower than normal trip. Be especially alert\nwhen approaching bridges, overpasses, and curves.\n\nA Wind Chill Advisory means that very cold air and strong winds\nwill combine to generate low wind chill values. This will result\nin frost bite and lead to hypothermia if precautions are not\ntaken. If you must venture outdoors, make sure you wear a hat and\ngloves, making sure all exposed skin is covered.\n\nIn Illinois, the latest road conditions can be obtained on the\nInternet at www.gettingaroundillinois.com. In Missouri, the\nlatest road conditions can be obtained on the Internet at\ntraveler.modot.org/map/ or by calling 1-888-275-6636.",
