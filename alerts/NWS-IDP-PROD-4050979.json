The fog is not yet widespread, but this only means that\nvisibility may change suddenly over short distances.\n\nWith temperatures well below freezing, the dense fog may also\ndeposit frost on untreated surfaces, resulting in slippery roads\nand sidewalks.\n\nIf driving, be prepared for changing visibility, dropping to near\nzero at times. Slow down and use low beam headlights, and leave\nplenty of distance ahead of you.",
