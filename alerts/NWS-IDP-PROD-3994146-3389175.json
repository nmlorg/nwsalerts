Expect strong breaking waves, shore break,\nand strong longshore and rip currents making swimming\ndifficult and dangerous.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of the large surf, strong\nonshore winds, high astronomical tides, and elevated ocean water\nlevels will likely produce wave runup and localized beach\nerosion along east facing shores during the next few days.",
