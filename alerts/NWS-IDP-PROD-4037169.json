If these\nstrong winds persist...a wind advisory will be needed for portions\nof deep south Texas for the rest of tonight.\n\nBe sure to secure light weight objects, such as lawn furniture and\ntrash cans. Additionally, drivers of high profile vehicles are\nurged to drive with caution, especially if driving on east to west\nhighways, flyovers, bridges, and causeways.\n\nStay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio or your local media for further\nupdates.",
