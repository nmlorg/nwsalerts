The front is scheduled into northeast Nebraska\nmid Wednesday morning. Snow, possibly mixed with rain initially,\nand strong northwest winds gusting to 40 mph, will accompany the\nfront as it moves southeast. Temperatures in the middle 30s as\nthe front arrives will cause precipitation to melt initially,\nwith temperatures falling rapidly into the 20s by early\nafternoon. This will likely cause flash freezing of melted\nprecipitation and very slippery driving conditions. Also, snow\nand blowing snow with the strong northwest winds will cause\ngreatly reduced visibilities.\n\n* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of up to one\ninch. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of northeast Nebraska and west central Iowa.\n\n* WHEN...From 9 AM to 6 PM CST Wednesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
