        "description": "...FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT BEGINNING MONDAY AFTERNOON AS HEAVY RAIN\nRETURNS TO THE AREA...\n\n.Beginning Monday afternoon, a stalled frontal boundary will\nbring moderate to heavy rainfall to the southwest North Carolina\nmountains, parts of northeast Georgia, and far western Upstate\nSouth Carolina. With the ground saturated from heavy rainfall\nlast week and rivers still running high, flooding impacts are\npossible in areas that see more heavy rain Monday night.\n\nThe Flood Watch continues for\n\n* portions of northeast Georgia, western North Carolina, and\nupstate South Carolina, including the following areas, in\nnortheast Georgia, Franklin, Habersham, Rabun, and Stephens.\nIn western North Carolina, Graham, Haywood, Macon, Northern\nJackson, Southern Jackson, Swain, and Transylvania. In upstate\nSouth Carolina, Greater Oconee, Greater Pickens, Oconee\nMountains, and Pickens Mountains.\n\n* from Monday afternoon through Tuesday evening\n\n* Rainfall amounts of 2-3 inches (locally higher in some spots)\nMonday night and Tuesday are expected, which may lead to new\nflooding and worsen conditions in areas that have not yet\nrecovered from flooding last week. Saturated ground and\ncontinued high river and stream levels may lead to flooding\ndeveloping quickly.\n\n* Rapid rises above bankfull on streams and creeks may occur,\nalong with the threat of flooded roadways. Flooding is also\nlikely to re-develop on larger rivers. The heavy rainfall will\nalso greatly increase the risk of landslides.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
