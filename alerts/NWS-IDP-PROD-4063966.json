        "description": "At 6 AM, surface observations, satellite imagery and traffic\ncameras indicated that patchy dense fog had formed in Brevard,\nIndian River, Saint Lucie and Okeechobee counties. The fog was\nreducing visibilities below one mile across many areas, and below\none half mile in some locations. The fog had not yet reached\nMartin County but could develop there in the next hour or so. The\nfog will lift by 9 am.\n\nIf you will be out driving early this morning, you should plan on\nleaving early, to allow yourself extra time to safely reach your\ndestination. When driving in dense fog, reduce your speed, use your\nlow beam headlights, and leave extra distance between your vehicle\nand the one in front of you.",
