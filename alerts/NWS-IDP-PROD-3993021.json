Widespread\nrainfall amounts of two to three inches, with a potential for\nlocally higher amounts is possible during this time frame.\nUncertainty remains regarding the exact track of the associated\nstorm system and ultimate location of the heaviest and highest\nrainfall amounts. However, the potential exists for flooding of\nlow-lying and poorly drained areas, as well as subsequent river\nrises this weekend and into next week.\n\nThis outlook means that elevated water levels and potential\nimpacts are possible. Persons should closely monitor forecasts\nincluding the possibility of flood watches, warnings, and\nadvisories.",
