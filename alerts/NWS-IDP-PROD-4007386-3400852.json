This is a result of\nup to about 4 inches of rain that fell late last week and the\nweekend.\n\nThe large majority of the Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers\nare either in flood or expected to flood, with some locations\nreaching moderate flood stage.  Crests are expected to be the\nhighest since either February or June of 2019.\n\nAs of Monday morning, flooding had ended along many of the smaller\nstreams with minor to moderate flooding occurring along the main\nstem rivers. The Wabash River was rising along the full length.  The\ncrest along the White River was near Ravenswood. The crest along the\nEast Fork White River was between Seymour and Rivervale. Flooding\nalong the lower portions of the White and Wabash River is likely to\ncontinue through the end of the month.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday which\nwill allow smaller rivers to continue to recede this week.\nAdditional heavy rainfall of 1 to 2 inches is possible this weekend\nwhich could exacerbate ongoing flooding.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River at Seymour.\n* until Friday evening.\n* At  8:45 AM Monday the stage was 17.8 feet.\n* Flood stage is 12.0 feet.\n* Moderate flooding is occurring and Moderate flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by Friday\nmorning.\n* At 18.0 feet...Extensive flooding is in progress.  More than 50% of\nthe flood plain in Jackson County is underwater.  Flood waters near\nthe east edge of Medora.  High water isolates wastewater treatment\nplant at Seymour.  Many county roads that do not cross the river\nbegin to flood.  Many state and county roads are impassable by\nwater.  High water affects many rural residents...but only a few\nevacuations are necessary.  Flood waters surround most river\ncabins.",
