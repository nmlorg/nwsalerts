Portions of Highway 987 in Harlan county are also\nflooded. Kelly Street near Bailey Creek is under water. A mudslide\noccurred late this morning on Highway 421 just to the north of the\nHarlan, Leslie county line and was blocking the road.\n\nSome locations that will experience flooding include...\nHazard, Whitesburg, Harlan, Hyden, Whitley City, Letcher, Bath,\nCumberland, Jenkins, Loyall, Elkhorn City and Evarts.",

Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nExcessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of small\ncreeks and streams, country roads, farmland, and other low lying\nspots.\n\nIn hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are\npotentially dangerous in heavy rain.
