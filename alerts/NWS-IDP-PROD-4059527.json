        "description": "Gale force winds are expected to impact surrounding waters of American\nSamoa within 48 hours. A possible developing tropical cyclone embedded\nwithin an active monsoon trough to the northwest of the Samoa Island\nChain, is anticipated to bring northeast winds of at least 35 knots,\nwith higher gusts, and seas up to 20 feet. Seas and winds are much\nhigher near thunderstorms.\n\nGale force winds and dangerous seas could capsize or damage vessels\nand the frequent showers could reduce visibility.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible hazardous\nconditions. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or\nsecure the vessel for severe wind and seas.\n\nListen to NOAA Weather Radio for the latest updates.
