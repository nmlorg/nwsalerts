        "description": "...Period of Light Freezing Rain Friday Morning...\n\n.Low pressure tracking across the Ohio Valley into the Great\nLakes will spread rain across the Mid Atlantic region beginning\nlate tonight or early Friday, continuing into Friday night.

With temperatures hovering near 32F, ice\naccumulations are expected to primarily be confined to elevated\nobjects such as trees, power lines, and decks, as well as some\nuntreated bridges and overpasses.\n\n* WHAT...Freezing rain, briefly mixed with sleet and snow early,\nchanging to rain by midday. Only trace amounts of snow and ice\nexpected. Ice accumulations of 0.01 to 0.05 inch. Winds gusting\nas high as 35 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of southwest Virginia and northwest North\nCarolina, mainly along the Blue Ridge.\n\n* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 1 PM EST Friday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Some bridges, overpasses, and mainly secondary\nuntreated roads could become slippery and hazardous early Friday\nmorning.
