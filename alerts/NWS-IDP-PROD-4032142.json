While precipitation will remain\nvery light, temperatures will only edge up slowly from the upper\n20s to lower 30s this morning. This will allow for some minor\nglazing on area roadways which will lead to hazardous travel at\ntimes. Drive with care as it will be difficult to see where the\nglazing has occurred.",
