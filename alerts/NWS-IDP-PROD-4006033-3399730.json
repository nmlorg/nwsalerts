        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nBig Blue River...Big Walnut Creek...Driftwood River...East Fork\nWhite River...Eel River...Fall Creek...Flatrock River...Mill\nCreek...Mississinewa River...Sugar Creek...Tippecanoe River...\nWabash River...White River...Wildcat Creek...Youngs Creek...\n\n\n.Minor to moderate flooding continues on many waterways late Sunday\nafternoon on most waterways.  This is a result of copious rain that\nfell between late Thursday and late Saturday.  Radar precipitation\nestimates indicate the heaviest rainfall of up to nearly four inches\nfell in western Indiana, chiefly south of Interstate 74.\n\nThe large majority of the Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers\nare expected to flood, with some locations reaching moderate flood\nstage.  Crests are expected to be the highest since either February\nor June of 2019.\n\nAs of late Sunday afternoon, the Wabash River was rising along the\nentire length of the river.  The crest is expected to reach Lafayette\nMonday morning.  The crest on the White River is approaching\nNoblesville.  It will begin falling there on Monday. The crest on the\nEast Fork White River is in the Columbus and Seymour areas.  Flooding\non the Wabash and and White Rivers will last into at least late next\nweek.  Flooding on the East Fork White River will last until probably\nlate Monday or early Tuesday next week.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Wednesday, thus\narea waterways will be able to continue their movement to normal\nlevels.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River at Williams.\n* until Tuesday January 21.\n* At  7:00 AM Sunday the stage was 7.9 feet.\n* Flood stage is 8.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...Rise above flood stage by this afternoon and continue to\nrise to near 13.2 feet by Thursday afternoon.  It will fall below\nflood stage by Tuesday January 21.\n* At 13.2 feet...During the July 2015 summer flood, water began to\noverflow the road to the new Williams Bridge.  SR 450 closes in\nseveral locations. Most local roads in the flood plain are\nimpassable at this level.  Huron-Williams Road flooded south of\nPort Williams Road.  The summer flood crest of 13.2 feet came 3\nweeks later in the summer season than the June 28, 1960 crest of\n15.1 feet and is believed to be the latest for the summer season\nsince at least the late 1940s.",
