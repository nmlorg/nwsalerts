        "description": "A brief period of snow overspreads the northern Worcester Hills\nlate this morning into early afternoon. Any snow accumulations\nshould be rather light on the order of a coating to 1 inch. The\nsnow may change to a brief period of sleet and freezing rain\nduring the afternoon before changing to all rain by early evening.\n\nWhile any snow and ice amounts will be very minor, untreated roads\nmay become slippery by late this morning and especially this\nafternoon. The main area of concern is the northern Worcester\nHills at elevations near and above 1000 feet. Motorists planning\ntravel later today in this region should be prepared for slippery\ntravel and allow extra time to reach their destination.",
