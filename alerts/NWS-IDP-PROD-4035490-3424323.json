For the Hard Freeze Watches, from late Monday\nevening through early Tuesday morning and late Tuesday evening\nthrough early Wednesday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Damaging winds will blow down large objects such as\ntrees and power lines.

If possible, remain in the lower levels of\nyour home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if\nyou must drive.\n\nTake steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent\nfreezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should\nbe wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have\nin-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-\nground pipes to protect them from freezing.",
