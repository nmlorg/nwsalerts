In southeast West\nVirginia, Eastern Greenbrier, Mercer, Monroe, Summers, and\nWestern Greenbrier.\n\n* Through Friday morning\n\n* An extended period of rainfall with high rainfall rates and\nthunderstorms today and tonight create favorable conditions for\nflooding. Rainfall totals of 2 to 3 inches are expected with\nlocally higher amounts possible.\n\n* The ground will be saturated when thunderstorms are most\nlikely. High rainfall rates inside of these storms could\npotentially create rapid water rises, especially in small\ncreeks and streams, areas with poor drainage, and low lying\nareas.",
