        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nBig Blue River...Big Walnut Creek...Driftwood River...East Fork\nWhite River...Eel River...Fall Creek...Flatrock River...Mill\nCreek...Mississinewa River...Sugar Creek...Tippecanoe River...\nWabash River...White River...Wildcat Creek...Youngs Creek...\n\n\n.Most river sites have rising water levels as of Sunday afternoon\nthroughout central and southern Indiana.  This is a result of\ncopious rain that fell between late Thursday and late Saturday.\nRadar precipitation estimates indicate the heaviest rainfall of up to\nnearly four inches has fallen in western Indiana, chiefly south of\nInterstate 74.\n\nThe large majority of the Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers\nare expected to flood, with some locations reaching moderate flood\nstage.  Crests are expected to be the highest since either\nFebruary or June of 2019.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Tuesday afternoon.\n\nPlease be aware of flooded roads and do not attempt to cross\nflooded areas if you cannot see the road.  Occupied vehicles have\nbeen reported in flood waters in Jennings and Morgan counties\nSaturday afternoon and evening.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River at Williams.\n* until Wednesday January 22.\n* At  7:00 AM Sunday the stage was 7.9 feet.\n* Flood stage is 8.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...Rise above flood stage by this evening and continue to\nrise to near 13.5 feet by Thursday evening.  It will fall below\nflood stage by Tuesday January 21.\n* At 13.2 feet...During the July 2015 summer flood, water began to\noverflow the road to the new Williams Bridge.  SR 450 closes in\nseveral locations. Most local roads in the flood plain are\nimpassable at this level.  Huron-Williams Road flooded south of\nPort Williams Road.  The summer flood crest of 13.2 feet came 3\nweeks later in the summer season than the June 28, 1960 crest of\n15.1 feet and is believed to be the latest for the summer season\nsince at least the late 1940s.",
