Therefore, though the flash flood threat has ended for\nthis event, a Flood Warning has been issued to continue to\nhighlight numerous ongoing flooding impacts.\n\n* Numerous roads will remain closed across the warned area.\nDO NOT DRIVE THROUGH FLOODED ROADWAYS. Please obey all barricades.\nIt is extremely difficult at night to assess the depth of flooding\nand roads may be damaged or washed away underneath the flood\nwaters.  Barricades remain in place until engineers can assess\nthe stability of the road or bridge and ensure its safety.\n\n* Some locations that may continue to experience flooding include...\nGreenville Downtown, Greenville Eastside, West Greenville, Mauldin,\nTaylors, Simpsonville, Berea, Five Forks, Fountain Inn and Welcome.",
        "instruction": "Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding in urban\nareas. Storm drains, streams and other drainages will become\noverwhelmed by excessive rainfall, flooding low-lying roads,\nintersections, and parking lots. Underpasses are especially dangerous\nbecause sudden flood waters can quickly surround and submerge your\nvehicle. Stay alert and avoid flood-prone areas.\n\nNumerous roads, parking lots and bridges are threatened by floodwaters.\nPlease pay close attention to road signs indicating a flood-prone area.\nObey all barricades, even if water is not currently over the road.\nBarricades are in place for your protection and indicate areas where\nflooding can occur rapidly and without warning.",
