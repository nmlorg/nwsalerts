        "description": "The arctic cold front has dropped south of the area. The light\nsnow will taper off to flurries this evening, except across Vilas\nCounty where scattered snow showers will linger into Thursday\nmorning. Any additional snow accumulation should be less than an\ninch, except for locally higher amounts across the snowbelt region\nof northwest Vilas County.\n\nThe combination of the snow, along with melting snow from this\nafternoon and falling air temperatures well below freezing could\nlead to a flash freeze this evening. Gusty northerly winds may\nalso create some areas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nOvernight, temperatures are expected to fall into the single\ndigits below zero. The combination of the cold temperatures and\ngusty northerly winds will produce wind chill readings in the\n15 below to 25 below zero range late tonight into Thursday\nmorning. Wind chill readings this low can produce frost bite\nwithin 30 minutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving this evening as\nroads will be slippery due to ice or snow. If venturing outdoors,\nwear layers of clothing along with a hat and gloves to protect\nyourself from the bitter cold.",
