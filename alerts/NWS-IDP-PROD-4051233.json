        "description": "Colder air this morning and a passing disturbance will bring a\nrisk for freezing rain, sleet, or snow over parts of the Texas\nSouth Plains and southern Texas Panhandle mainly north of Lubbock.\nAccumulations in general today are expected to be light although\nslick spots may develop on some roads and especially overpasses.\n\nA larger threat for widespread snowfall and ice glazing will\ndevelop tonight through Tuesday and early Wednesday when a potent\nupper level trough overrides even colder air plunging into the\nregion. Snowfall accumulations will be possible over most of the\narea, especially the northwestern South Plains and southern Texas\nPanhandle. And ice glazing may develop especially across the South\nPlains and Rolling Plains. Many roads could become hazardous\nlater tonight into Wednesday from ice and snow accumulations.\n\nA Winter Storm Watch already is in effect for the northwestern\nSouth Plains into the Texas Panhandle. But keep in mind that\nhazardous travel could also expand through the entire Texas South\nPlains region as well as adjacent portions of New Mexico and\nOklahoma.",
