Roads may\nbecome slushy, but temperatures are expected to be just above\nfreezing, limiting the impact. Elevations above 4000 feet will\nexperience the greatest impact where roads may become snow\ncovered. Motorists are advised to drive with extra caution,\nmore so due to the decrease in visibility from the snow and wet\nroads.",
