        "description": "Another weak storm system will bring rain and snow to northeast\nCalifornia, the Sierra, and western Nevada Saturday night into\nSunday. Snow levels start rather high Saturday night, but fall to\nnear 5500 feet Sunday. Precipitation amounts will be limited and\nthe higher snow levels will cap snow accumulations below 7000\nfeet. Along the Sierra Crest, isolated spots could get more than 8\ninches of snow, but the higher passes through the Sierra can\nexpect only 3 to 6 inches. Even this small amount of snow could\ncause travel delays by Sunday morning.\n\nAt Lake Tahoe, accumulations up to a couple inches are possible.\nIn Mono County, accumulations should be confined to the mountains\nwest of Highway 395, and only 3 to 6 inches are expected above\n7500 feet.\n\nWinds will also increase late Saturday night into Sunday, with\ngusts in the 30 to 40 mph in wind prone areas east of the Sierra\nCrest. For most other areas, gusts should be no higher than 30\nmph. These winds will also cause choppy conditions on Lake Tahoe.",
