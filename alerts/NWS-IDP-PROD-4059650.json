The fog was reducing visibilities to between 1 and 3 miles\nacross many areas, and below one half mile in some locations. the\nfog had yet to reach Martin County and portions of Saint Lucie\nCounty, but could develop in these areas before sunrise.\n\nThe fog will persist through about 9 AM. Should dense fog with\nvisibilities of less than one quarter mile become more widespread\nthen a Dense Fog Advisory will be issued.\n\nIf you will be out driving early this morning, you should plan on\nleaving early, to allow yourself extra time to safely reach your\ndestination. When driving in dense fog, reduce your speed, use your\nlow beam headlights, and leave extra distance between your vehicle\nand the one in front of you.",
