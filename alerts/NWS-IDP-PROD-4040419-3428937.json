Between 2 and 4\ninches of rain have already fallen across much of northwest\nAlabama, and the additional rainfall will further contribute to\nponding of water on roads and flooding of low lying areas that\nnormally experience poor drainage.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nFlorence, Muscle Shoals, Russellville, Sheffield, Tuscumbia,\nMoulton, Red Bay, Rogersville, Phil Campbell and Killen.",
