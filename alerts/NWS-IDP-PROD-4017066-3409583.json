Winds veer west to 30 knots by midday Saturday with\ngusts up to 40 knot gales continuing through early Sunday\nmorning.\n\n* WAVES...Waves build to 8 to 14 feet occasionally 18 feet on\nSaturday and persist into Sunday morning.\n\n* FREEZING SPRAY...Ice may rapidly accumulate on decks and\nsuperstructures which could result in a loss of vessel\nstability.",
        "instruction": "A Gale Warning means winds of 34 to 47 knots are imminent or\noccuring. Operating a vessel in gale conditions requires\nexperience and properly equipped vessels. It is highly\nrecommended that mariners without the proper experience seek safe\nharbor prior to the onset of gale conditions.\n\n\nA Heavy Freezing Spray Watch is issued when the risk of heavy\nfreezing spray has significantly increased...but the specific\ntiming and/or location is still uncertain.  It is intended to\nprovide additional lead time for mariners who may wish to\nconsider altering their plans.",
