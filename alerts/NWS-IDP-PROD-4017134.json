        "description": "Northeast to east winds will increase rapidly over the Keys waters\nthis evening as a cold front spreads to the southwest.\n\nAt 5 pm, most of the waters were experiencing northeast to east\nwinds of 10 to 15 knots. However, the front had just reach Carysfort\nReef Light, where winds had recently jumped to near 25 knots and\ncontinued to rise. As the front continues to the southwest, locations\nfurther down the Keys will see a similar increase in wind.\n\nBy 8 pm, the front is expected to have passed waters adjacent to the\nLower Keys and will have swept across the offshore Gulf waters. Soon\nthereafter, the front will continue to sweep southwest past the Dry\nTortugas and the Marquesas Keys. As the front approaches, expect an\nincrease in squally shower activity with a sudden increase in\nsustained winds to near 25 knots. Later tonight, a further rise to as\nhigh as 30 knots is possible.",
