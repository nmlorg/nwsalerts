        "description": "...Light snow and Blowing Snow Heading In This Afternoon,\nFollowed By Very Cold Wind Chills...\n\n.An incoming Arctic cold front will move in this afternoon\nbringing with it light snow and increasingly strong and gusty\nnorthwest winds. These winds will produce areas of blowing and\ndrifting snow across open, unsheltered areas of southeast\nMinnesota and northeast Iowa. Hazardous conditions will likely\ndevelop due to reduced visibility and slippery roadways. Much\ncolder temperatures then filter in tonight through Friday, which\nwill result in wind chills ranging from -20 to -35 degrees. Any\nresidual moisture left on roadways may freeze and create icy\nconditions as well.\n\n* WHAT...Very cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as low as\n25 below zero.\n\n* WHERE...In Iowa, Clayton and Allamakee Counties. In Minnesota,\nHouston, Winona and Wabasha Counties.\n\n* WHEN...From midnight tonight to noon CST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...The cold wind chills could cause frostbite on\nexposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.",
