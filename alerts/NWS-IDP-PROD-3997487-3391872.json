Some shoreline erosion will occur.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Northeast winds will increase Saturday and\nremain strong through Saturday night. This onshore flow will\nlead to rising water levels and high waves, resulting in\nsignificant shoreline flooding. Low lying areas along Saginaw\nBay will be particularly susceptible to flooding, as the river\nlevel is forecast to peak near 80 inches above chart datum\nSaturday evening at Essexville. Potential exists for flooding to\nextend up the Saginaw River into Bay City.",
