The surf zone will be dangerous\ndue to strong currents and powerful breaking waves. This\nthreat will be maximized on steeply sloped beaches. Rip\ncurrents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large\nbreaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and\nrocks, and capsize small boats near shore.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Swell heights 11 to 14 feet at 20 to 22\nseconds. This will generate breaking waves of 20 to 25 feet,\nfavored locations may exceed 25 feet.",
