Visibilities in spots have dropped to\none quarter mile or less.\n\nMotorists in these areas are urged to slow down and drive with\nextra caution, as visibilities will vary significantly given the\npatchy nature of the fog. Use low beams, reduce driving speed, and\nallow for plenty of room between you and other cars.\n\nThe patchy dense fog may spread into the Janesville and Madison\nearly this morning as well. Temperatures are right around\nfreezing, so isolated slick spots may develop on untreated\nroadways.\n\nThe patchy dense fog should begin to burn off between 6 am and 8\nam CST.",
