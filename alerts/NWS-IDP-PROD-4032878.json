Low\ntemperatures Sunday night in the Sacramento Valley will be in the\n30s, locally below freezing possible in wind sheltered areas,\nwith mostly teens and 20s in the foothills and mountains.\n\nSnow levels drop Sunday into the foothills during the afternoon\ninto evening. Overall snow amounts will be light. Locally upwards\nof around 5 inches possible over higher elevations of the Western\nPlumas mountains and Northern Sierra Nevada. Local snow\naccumulations of an inch are also possible in the higher\nelevations of the foothills Sunday afternoon and night. Travel\ninto the mountains could be slow with possible chain controls.\nThose heading into the high country Sunday should check the latest\nroad conditions prior to departure.",
