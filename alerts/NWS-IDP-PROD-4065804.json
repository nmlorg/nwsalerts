        "description": "Storm force winds of at least 30-50 kts will continue to threaten\nthe coastal waters extending 40 nautical miles from Manua and\nSwains through Wednesday, as a complex environment within the\nactive monsoon trough keeps the possibility of a tropical cyclone\ndeveloping over or near the islands. Seas of 20 to 25 feet or\nhigher will remain through Tuesday, with higher seas near\nthunderstorms.\n\nA storm warning means sustained winds of 48-63 kts (55-73 mph) or\ngreater, is either predicted or occurring, and not directly\nassociated with a tropical cyclone.\n\nStorm force winds and dangerous seas could capsize or damage\nvessels and the frequent showers could reduce visibility.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible hazardous\nconditions. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or\nsecure the vessel for severe wind and seas.\n\nListen to NOAA Weather Radio for the latest updates.\n\nYou may also follow us on Facebook \"NWSPagoPago\" or our website\nat www.weather.gov/ppg.",
