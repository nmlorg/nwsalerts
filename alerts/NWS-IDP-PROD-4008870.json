In\naddition, heavy rain with rainfall rates in excess of a half inch\nper hour and minor flooding will also be possible with these showers\nand thunderstorms.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nRaleigh, Cary, Creedmoor, Louisburg, Wake Forest, Garner, Zebulon,\nFranklinton, Kittrell and Bunn.",

Wind gusts as high as\n40 mph are capable of knocking down tree limbs and blowing around\ntrash cans, potted plants, lawn furniture and other light outdoor\nobjects.\n\nLocally heavy rain will quickly reduce visibility and result in\nponding of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and\nminor flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.\nDrivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid\nhydroplaning, especially in urban areas where prolonged heavy rain\ncan quickly lead to flooding.",
