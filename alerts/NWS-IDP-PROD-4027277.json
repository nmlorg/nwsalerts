In addition, with\ntemperatures close to freezing, black ice remains a possibility\nespecially on bridges, overpasses and off ramps.\n\nSome areas impacted by the dense fog include Gladwin, Standish,\nTawas, West Branch, Harrisville, Houghton Lake, Grayling and\nGaylord.\n\nSlow down if traveling across this area early this morning.\nConditions should gradually improve after sunrise.",
