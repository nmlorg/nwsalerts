        "description": "A low pressure system moving by to our south is expected to\ngenerate light amounts of wintry precipitation tonight and\nWednesday morning across much of the region, with the most\naccumulations of snow or sleet expected across parts of\nsoutheastern Missouri and adjacent parts of southern Illinois.\nSnow and sleet accumulations of up to an inch are possible in the\nhigher elevations of the Missouri Ozark Foothills, with lesser\namounts expected elsewhere.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to hover near the freezing mark during\nthis time. This, combined with relatively warm road surface\ntemperatures, will tend to limit any impacts to travel. However,\ndrivers should still be watchful for any slick spots that might\ndevelop on elevated road surfaces, such as bridges and overpasses.",
