        "instruction": "A Small Craft Advisory means that wind speeds of 21 to 33 knots\nand/or seas 10 feet or higher are expected to produce hazardous\nwave conditions to small craft. Inexperienced mariners,\nespecially those operating smaller vessels should avoid\nnavigating in these conditions.\n\nA Gale Watch is issued when the risk of gale force winds of 34 to\n47 knots has significantly increased, but the specific timing\nand/or location is still uncertain. It is intended to provide\nadditional lead time for mariners who may wish to consider\naltering their plans.",
