        "description": "...HEAVY MOUNTAIN SNOW MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON...\n\n.A cold front will bring widespread precipitation to northwest\nCalifornia Monday night into Tuesday. Snow levels will be much\nhigher than with last week's storm, initially around 4500 feet,\nthen tending to fall closer to 4000 feet on Tuesday. This will\nresult in mostly rain and wet road conditions along the passes of\nHighway 299, and just minor accumulations, if any, along Highway\n36. However, up to a foot of snow will be possible above 4500\nfeet, including Scott Mountain Summit on Highway 3.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow possible above 4500 feet. Total snow\naccumulations of 6 to 12 inches possible. Winds could gust as\nhigh as 50 mph in exposed mountainous terrain.\n\n* WHERE...Northern Trinity County including Scott Mountain Summit\non Highway 3.\n\n* WHEN...From Monday evening through Tuesday afternoon.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. Chain\nrequirements over Scott Mountain Summit and periods of road\nclosure are possible. Blowing and drifting snow could make\nvisibility poor.",
        "instruction": "* If you must travel, carry an emergency kit with tire chains,\nflashlight, batteries, blankets, food, water, and medications.\n\n* Plan now to avoid traveling during the storm.\n\n* The latest road conditions for the state of California can be\nobtained by calling 1-800-GAS-ROAD.",
