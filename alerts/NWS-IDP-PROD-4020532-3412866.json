Crests will be/are comparable\nto those that occurred in February and June of 2019.  Minor\nflooding developed late Saturday afternoon on the Eel River that\nwill come to an end this afternoon.\n\nA mix of precipitation Friday and Saturday totaled as high as\napproximately 1.50 inches, which will slow river falls or bring\nlower secondary crests on the major rivers, and produce additional\nminor flooding on smaller ones.  Flooding has returned to Seymour on\nthe East Fork White River, and this afternoon it will return to\nSpencer on the White River.  The Driftwood River near Edinburgh will\nbe near bankfull, with a crest near flood stage Sunday morning.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers will\ncontinue until about Wednesday, January 29.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is forecast through midday Thursday.  This\nwill give area waterways several days to drain and return to near\nnormal levels.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River at Spencer.\n* from this afternoon to Wednesday morning.\n* At 9:30 AM Sunday the stage was 13.2 feet.\n* Flood stage is 14.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...Rise above flood stage by this afternoon and continue to\nrise to near 15.8 feet by Monday evening  and will rise later to\n15.8 by Monday evening. It will fall below flood stage by Tuesday\nevening.\n* At 16.0 feet...Flood water affects gravel pit.  High water concerns\nfarmers in agricultural season about crops and livestock.  Lowest\nportions of Trails 1 and 7 in McCormicks Creek Park flood.",
