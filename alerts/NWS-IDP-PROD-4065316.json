This should linger the fog longest in north Lake and\nnorthwest Volusia counties but even there, the fog should lift by\n9 am. The fog will reduce visibilities below one half mile in\nsome locations.\n\nMotorists should be prepared for rapidly changing visibilities.\nWhen driving in dense fog, reduce your speed, use your low beam\nheadlights, and leave extra distance between your vehicle and the\none in front of you.",
