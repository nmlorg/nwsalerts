The next system and cold\nfront Friday will bring 1 to 2 inches of precipitation. The snow\nlevel will start off low at about 1000 feet but will rise to over\n3000 feet as the precipitation comes in. With the Skokomish River\nnot far below flood stage by that time, there is a good chance the\nstorm will be enough to drive the Skokomish back up above flood\nstage Friday night.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Chehalis River Above Grand Mound\n* Until this evening.\n* At  9:00 AM Thursday the stage was 141.1 feet.\n* Flood stage is 141.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...The river has crested and will continue to fall to below\nflood stage late this morning.\n* Impact...At 141.0 feet, the Chehalis River in Thurston County will\nflood several roads in Independence Valley including James Road...\nIndependence Road and Moon road. Flood waters will also cover\nnearby farm lands.",
