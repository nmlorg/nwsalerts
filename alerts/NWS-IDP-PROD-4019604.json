        "description": "Hazardous travel will linger into tonight. Although scattered snow\nshowers and flurries are expected, additional snow accumulations\nwill be minor outside of the Lake Superior snowbelt. But west\nwinds gusting to 30 to 35 mph at times will produce some blowing\nand drifting of the snow. This could significantly reduce the\nvisibility in open areas, especially on north-south roads. In\naddition, pavement can turn icy very quickly in areas where snow\nblowing across the road and gets packed down by traffic.\nAs temperatures fall overnight, any lingering water on the roads\ncould also refreeze into black ice.\n\nBe sure to use extra caution if traveling tonight, especially in\nopen areas. Slow down if you encounter reduced visibility due\nto blowing snow. Expect to encounter icy pavement in these areas,\nand leave plenty of distance between your vehicle and those around\nyou.",
