Overflowing poor drainage areas will\nresult in minor flooding in the advisory area. Falling rocks on\narea roads have also been a problem. Up to three quarters of an\ninch of rain has already fallen.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nEl Centro, Calexico, Imperial, Plaster City, Ocotillo, Mt. Signal,\nEl Centro Naval Airfield, Heber, Coyote Wells, Dixieland and\nSeeley.",

Do not attempt to cross flooded\nroads. Find an alternate route.",
