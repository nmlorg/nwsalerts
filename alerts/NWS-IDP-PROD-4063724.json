        "description": "Strong east-to-southeast winds will develop through Turnagain Arm\nand the Matanuska Valley Monday night with winds expected to\napproach 70 mph in Turnagain Arm and 60 mph around areas of the\nMatanuska Valley. Warm temperatures with these winds will bring\nthe potential for rain and snow Monday night until the front moves\nthrough the area Tuesday morning.\n\nCold air behind this front will turn precipitation to all snow\nlate Tuesday morning or early afternoon, and there is the\npotential for significant snow rates and snow accumulations from\nAnchorage through the Matanuska Valley. The biggest question is\nwhether the front stalls over the region or pushes farther\neastward. Temperatures should also remain in the lower to mid 30s\non Tuesday which will make it a heavy, wet snow.\n\nStay tuned to the latest forecasts by visiting weather.gov/afc.",
