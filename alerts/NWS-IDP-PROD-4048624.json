The first round of rain will impact the area Sunday evening\nthrough Monday morning, and this could produce widespread 0.5 to\n1.0 inch totals with locally higher amounts. The second round\nwill affect the area Wednesday and Thursday. Rainfall totals with\nthis system have trended lower, but additional rainfall amounts\nof 0.5 to 1.25 inches remain possible.\n\nMinor to moderate flooding is occurring or is forecast to occur\non the Ohio River and the Green River. Many small streams are\nstill at or near bankfull. Additionally, soil moisture remains\nvery high due to recent heavy rain. Any additional heavy rain\ncould lead to flooding of low-lying or poorly-drained areas.\nFlooding on main stem rivers could worsen or be prolonged. Small\nstreams may also flood or return to bankfull. Those with interests\nin flood-prone locations or near local rivers should prepare for\nthe potential of renewed or worsened flooding.",
