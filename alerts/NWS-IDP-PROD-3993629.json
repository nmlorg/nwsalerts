        "description": "Water is still reported to be flowing over the Deneki Road as a\nresult of a freeze up ice jam on Willow Creek upstream of the Deneki\nRoad bridge. The initial ice jam and rapid rise in water levels at\nthe Deneki Bridge occurred on December 21st. The ice jam forced\nwater into the floodplain on both the North and South sides of the\nriver. Water levels have fluctuated over the last two weeks and are\nexpected to continue to fluctuate as the river continues the normal\nfreeze-up process.\n\nThe ice jam is not expected to release until spring break-up.\nOnce the river upstream forms an ice cover water levels are\nexpected to decrease, but the ice jam rubble will remain in place\nupstream of the bridge. Areas of standing water will likely freeze\nwith forecast cold temperatures over the next one to two weeks.\n\nThe Matanuska Borough has been responding to the flooding on\nWillow Creek and maintains a website for updated information on\nroad conditions and access. Please check this website for current\nupdates on the conditions near Deneki Road:\nhttps://www.matsugov.us/spotlights/willow-creke-flooding-2019\n\nThe Borough has also been posting updates to their Facebook page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MatSuBorough",
