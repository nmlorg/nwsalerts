        "description": "Look for snow to gradually taper off from southwest to northeast\nearly this morning. The snow was already tapering to flurries in\ncentral Wisconsin, but pockets of moderate to heavy snow continued\nover the eastern Fox Valley and lakeshore areas. Within the\nheavier snow bands, very large flakes were accumulating rapidly,\nwith snowfall rates up to an inch an hour. The heaviest snows\nshould taper off over far northeast Wisconsin by 6 am, but light\naccumulating snow will linger over parts of Door County until 8\nam. Some locations will have totals in excess of 6 inches by the\ntime the snow ends.\n\nTravel conditions will be hazardous for the morning commute due\nto snow covered roads. The worst conditions will likely occur on\nsecondary roads, bridges and overpasses. Visibilities will be\nreduced to less than a mile at times in eastern Wisconsin through\n6 am. Please allow for extra travel time for your morning commute.",
