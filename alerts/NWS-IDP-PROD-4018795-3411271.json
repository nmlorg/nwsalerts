        "description": "...Winter Storm Producing Very Strong Winds Today...\n\nStrong northwest winds gusting around 45 mph today will lead to\nblowing and drifting snow, especially for areas that receive fresh\nsnow or have snow cover not encrusted by ice. Near whiteout\nconditions are possible in open and rural areas. Additional\nsnowfall through midday will range from a dusting to around an\ninch for most locations. For tonight, strong winds and very cold\ntemperatures will create wind chills of 15 to 25 below zero, with\nnear 30 below zero values possible in the far northwest forecast\narea.\n\n* WHAT...Additional snow accumulations of less than an inch.\nNorthwest winds gusting up to 45 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of north central and northwest Illinois.\n\n* WHEN...Now through 6 PM CST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Blowing snow could\nsignificantly reduce visibilities, mainly in open and rural\nareas.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...For locations that received ice\naccumulation, the heavy weight of the ice combined with strong\nwinds could bring down tree branches and lead to isolated power\noutages.",
