Flooding will\nend on all rivers tonight except for the Skokomish and lower\nChehalis Rivers. More precipitation in on tap for Friday into\nSaturday of 1 to 2.5 inches. However, the snow level over the\nCascades will be too low for storm runoff to cause any flooding.\nOver the Olympics, the snow level could reach 3000 to 4000 feet and\ncould be enough to stall the Skokomish River from falling below\nflood stage or send it back up above flood stage if it is below by\nthen.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Snoqualmie River Near Carnation\n* Until late tonight.\n* At  3:15 PM Wednesday the stage was 53.6 feet.\n* Flood stage is 54.0 feet.\n* Fell below flood stage early this afternoon.\n* No additional flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...The river fell below flood stage at  1:36 PM Wednesday\nand will continue to fall. Flooding will continue in some areas\nuntil the flood wave has completely passed downstream.\n* Impact...At 51.0 feet, the Snoqualmie River will spill over its\nbanks from Fall City downstream through Carnation and Duvall...with\nshallow water over some farm land and several roads.",
