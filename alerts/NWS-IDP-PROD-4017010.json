Scattered wintry showers are not likely to persist,\nso impacts and accumulations are not expected.\n\nWinds gusting between 30 and 40 mph will be common throughout\nSaturday as a cold front crosses the region. Localized gusts over\n40 mph are not out of the question. Secure any loose outdoor\nitems. These strong winds may bring down smaller limbs and could\nmake travel more difficult for high profile vehicles.",
