Rapidly changing conditions including\nsudden drops in visibility and quick coatings on roadways are\npossible with the snow squalls.\n\nSnow squalls are most likely across the higher terrain of New\nHampshire and western Maine however a few may impact the\nurbanized corridors of southern New Hampshire and extreme\nsouthwest Maine as well. The timing of these may impact the\nevening commute.\n\nBe prepared for areas of blowing and drifting snow. This could\nlead to temporary whiteout conditions and the potential for\ndangerous driving conditions.",
