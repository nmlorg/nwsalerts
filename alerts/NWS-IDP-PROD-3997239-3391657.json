The following\nforecast is based on observed and forecast 48 hour precipitation.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Grand Rapids has issued a\n\n* Flood Warning for\nthe Kalamazoo River At Marshall.\n* from late Saturday night to late Sunday night.\n* At 10:00 AM Friday the stage was 4.8 feet.\n* Flood stage is 8.0 feet.\n* Minor Flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast, rise above flood stage by Sunday morning and continue to\nrise to near 8.1 feet by midday Sunday. The river will fall below\nflood stage by Sunday early afternoon. It is possible a new record\ncrest could be reached from this storm.\n* Impact, at 8.0 feet...Expect minor flooding of residences and\napartments in low lying areas adjacent to the river.\n* Flood history, this crest compares to the all-time record crest of\n8.2 feet on Mar 29 1950.",
