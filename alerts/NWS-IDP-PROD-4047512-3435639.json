Cold and dry air in place across the\nregion ahead of this system will support snowfall as the\nprecipitation develops from the west-southwest through the later\nmorning hours. The highest snow accumulations will likely occur\nnear the junction of the Georgia, North Carolina, and South\nCarolina borders in the extreme southern Appalachians.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4\ninches, with isolated 4 to 6 inch amounts in the southwest part\nof the county.\n\n* WHERE...Macon County in the extreme southern North Carolina\nmountains.\n\n* WHEN...From 6 AM this morning to 7 PM EST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Accumulating snow on area roadways, and reduced\nvisibility in snow, could make travel very difficult.",
