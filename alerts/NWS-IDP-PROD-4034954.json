        "description": "Winter precipitation is likely to occur Tuesday night into\nWednesday across West Central Texas. As it looks right now, at\nleast a rain and snow mix is likely north of a Barnhart to Eden to\nBrownwood line Tuesday evening. Then, after midnight Tuesday\nnight, precipitation will likely become all snow north of an Ozona\nto Menard to Brownwood line, while elsewhere may see more of a\nrain and snow mix. Snow amounts are uncertain at the moment, but\nlooks like snow accumulations of at least an inch will be possible\nnorth of a Sterling City to Coleman line, while a half inch to an\ninch will be possible through the rest of the Concho Valley and\ninto southern Coleman County and Brown County. Any snow\naccumulations will make for hazardous road conditions for\nmotorists.\n\nConsiderable uncertainty exists regarding forecast snow amounts\nwith this weather system. Residents across West Central Texas\nshould continue to monitor the latest forecasts regarding this\ndeveloping winter weather system.",
