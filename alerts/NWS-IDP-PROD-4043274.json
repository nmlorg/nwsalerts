        "description": "Narrow, northwest-southeast oriented bands of snow will occur\nthrough midnight tonight across Fremont County. These snow bands\nwill be very localized in nature. It appears that the most\nsnowfall from these snow bands will be concentrated along highway\n26 from Shoshoni, east to the Natrona County line, along Gas\nHills Road/Highway 136 east of Riverton, and along Highway 135\nbetween Riverton and Sand Draw. These areas could see one to\nthree inches of snow accumulate over a relatively short period of\ntime. Less snowfall will likely fall in most other areas.\n\nTravelers should anticpate rapidly fluctuating visibility along\nwith changing road conditions where highways become rapidly slick\nand snow covered. Much of this snowfall will likely diminish by\nmidnight.",
