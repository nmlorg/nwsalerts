This moisture\nwill encounter air cold enough to produce a mixture of snow,\nsleet, and freezing rain across the northern North Carolina\nmountains. Temperatures will warm gradually from the southwest\nthrough late morning, but then fall again through the afternoon\nalong the higher ridges behind the departing front - permitting\nsnow showers to continue or return across the higher elevations.\nWindy conditions will develop this afternoon as well.\n\n* WHAT...Mixed precipitation expected. Snow, sleet, and freezing\nrain will likely produce snow accumulations of 1 to 2 inches,\nalong with a light glaze of ice from the freezing rain. Winds\nmay gust as high as 40 mph this afternoon.\n\n* WHERE...The northern mountains of western North Carolina,\nespecially across Avery County and also the higher elevations\nthroughout the northern mountains.\n\n* WHEN...Until 4 PM EST this afternoon.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous\nconditions could impact the morning commute. Windy conditions\nthis afternoon could yield a few power outages.",
