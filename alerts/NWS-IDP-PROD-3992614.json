        "description": "WEATHER...\n\n* Dropping temperatures ranging between 31 and 33 degrees may\ncause residual moisture from current snow activity to freeze\nand produce patchy slick spots on untreated roadways.\n\n* Widely varying snowfall is expected. Quick snow accumulations\nof up to 1 inch will be possible under heaviest snow activity.\n\n* Brief but rapid reduction of visibilities down to a half-mile\nor less expected under moderate to heavy snow showers.\n\nIMPACTS...\n\n* Accumulating snow may lead to slippery roads particularly on\nbridges, exit ramps and overpasses.\n\n* Moderate Snow will cause reductions of visibility to less\nthan one mile. There may be rapid fluctuations of visibility.",
        "instruction": "* Motorists are urged to use caution and account for variable\ndriving conditions by slowing down and allowing extra time.\n\n* Prepare, plan and stay informed. Visit http://go.usa.gov/c7kkP",
