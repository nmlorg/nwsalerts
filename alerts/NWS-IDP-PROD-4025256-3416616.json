        "description": "The National Weather Service in Grand Rapids has extended the\n\n* Flood Warning for...\nAn Ice Jam in...\nCentral Kalamazoo County in southwestern Michigan...\n\n* Until 130 PM EST Friday.\n\n* At 1111 AM EST, emergency management reported that the ice jam\ncausing flooding on the Kalamazoo River remains in place. The ice\njam begins about one-half mile downstream of the King Highway\nBridge, with chunks of ice backed up to near Sprinkle road. Water\nlevels have slowly dropped since yesterday, thanks to warmer\ntemperatures. However, the ice jam continues to back up water and\npose a hazard to anyone along the Kalamazoo River between the King\nHighway Bridge and downtown Comstock. Additional changes in water\nlevels are expected today, and all interested parties should\ncontinue to monitor conditions closely.",
        "instruction": "Water levels around ice jams are notoriously unpredictable, and can\nchange quickly with little or no warning. Anyone living or recreating\nnear the river should pay close attention over the next few days and\nprepare for additional changes in water levels.",
