        "description": "...Flash Flooding Likely to Occur Over Portions of Central Alabama...\n\n.There is a growing concern of flash flooding now with this rain\nsystem today, tonight and tomorrow. While overall we are\nexpecting 4 to 6 inches of rain across the northern half of the\narea. There is a growing confidence that some of this could occur\nover a 3 to 6 hours window this afternoon and then again into\ntonight. We could potentially see two or three heavy rain bands\nset up over the area during this time. With the heavy rain\ncombined with backlogged streams, rivers, and full reservoirs,\nflash flooding is a growing concern. Additionally ongoing river\nflooding and potential areal flooding will be possible. There is\na potential for areas that do not typically flood to see some\nflash flooding.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Birmingham has issued a\n\n* Flash Flood Watch for portions of central Alabama, east\ncentral Alabama, northeast Alabama, northwest Alabama, and\nwest central Alabama, including the following areas, in\ncentral Alabama, Bibb, Blount, Jefferson, Shelby, St. Clair,\nTalladega, and Walker. In east central Alabama, Calhoun, Clay,\nCleburne, and Randolph. In northeast Alabama, Cherokee and\nEtowah. In northwest Alabama, Marion and Winston. In west\ncentral Alabama, Fayette, Greene, Hale, Lamar, Pickens,\nSumter, and Tuscaloosa.\n\n* Through Tuesday afternoon.\n\n* Forecast rainfall of four to six inches, with locally higher\namounts possible. Some of the rainfall will occur over a three\nto six hour window, resulting in the flash flooding.",
