Rain will become moderate to heavy at times,\nparticularly Friday night and early Saturday. Rainfall totals\nThursday afternoon into Saturday evening look to be around 2 to 4\ninches, with locally higher amounts possible. The latest forecasts\nsuggest the highest totals will occur in the Maumee and Wabash\nriver basins, but confidence in the exact location of heaviest\nrainfall is low at this time. Areal flooding and minor to\nmoderate river flooding is possible. People living in flood prone\nlocations should closely monitor the forecast this week.",
