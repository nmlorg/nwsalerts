Strong\nnorth to northeast winds gusting up to 40 to 50 mph will build\nwaves to 12 to 18 feet with occasional waves up to 23 feet.\n\n* WHERE...The shoreline areas of Cook and Lake Counties in\nIllinois and Lake County in Indiana, with slightly lower wave\nheights in Porter County Indiana.\n\n* WHEN...Late tonight through Saturday night.\n\n* IMPACTS...The winds and large battering waves combined with\nnear record high lake levels could exacerbate already\nsignificant beach and shoreline erosion sustained in the past\nseveral months. Vulnerable structures along the shore may be\nheavily damaged. In addition, flood prone paths and roads\nalong the lake will be susceptible to lengthy closures due to\nthe expected long duration of high winds and waves. Heed any\nclosures and stay away from the edge of the lake.",
