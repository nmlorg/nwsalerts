For the High\nRip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents expected. For the\nCoastal Flood Advisory, salt-water intrusion over local roads\nand low- lying areas near beaches causing minor flooding,\nparticularly at high tide.\n\n* WHERE...Mayaguez and Vicinity.\n\n* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 PM AST Monday. For\nthe High Rip Current Risk, through late Monday night. For the\nCoastal Flood Advisory, until 6 PM AST Sunday. The next high\ntide for Rincon is between 3-5 AM Sunday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and\nlocalized beach erosion. High surf will wash over nearby rocks\nand jetties. Rip currents can sweep even the best\nswimmers away from shore into deeper water. During high tide,\ncoastal flooding is possible with water potentially covering\nstreets and low-lying areas.",

Take the necessary actions to\nprotect flood-prone property.\n\nInexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to\ndangerous surf conditions.\n\nSwim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and\nfloat. Don't swim against the current. If able, swim in a\ndirection following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the\nshore and call or wave for help.",
