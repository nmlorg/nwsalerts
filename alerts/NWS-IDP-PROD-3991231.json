        "description": "Moisture arriving from the west this morning ahead of a low\npressure system and associated cold front will spread a mixture of\nsnow, sleet, freezing, and rain across the North Carolina\nmountains. Temperatures will generally be warm enough to support\nmainly a cold rain in the valleys, but snow, sleet, and freezing\nrain will be possible at the onset of the precipitation through\ndaybreak at the higher elevations, with snow showers possibly\npersisting along the higher peaks into the afternoon behind the\ndeparting the cold front. At elevations above about 4500 feet,\nsnow accumulations could reach 1 to 2 inches, along with a light\nglaze of ice through mid-morning, especially across the high\nelevations around the Smokies and Balsams. Slippery spots could\ndevelop on roads in these areas this morning, and then windy\nconditions will pick up through the afternoon.\n\nUse caution if traveling today across the southern and central\nmountains of western North Carolina.",
