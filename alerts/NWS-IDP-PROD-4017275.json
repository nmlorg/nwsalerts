        "description": "Travel conditions are expected to deteriorate across the entire\narea this evening as a band of snow overspreads the area. At 615\npm, the leading edge of the snow extended from near Merrill to\nShawano to Kewaunee. The snow was spreading northeast at 35 mph,\nand should begin in the Rhinelander, Crandon, Wausaukee, and\nSturgeon Bay areas by 730 pm, and the remainder of far northeast\nWisconsin by 830 pm or 900 pm.\n\nThe snowfall intensity will pick up quickly once the snow begins.\nModerate to occasionally heavy snow is possible across the area\nduring the evening. As a result, travel conditions are likely to\ndeteriorate very quickly. Be sure to use extra caution if\ntraveling this evening, and allow for extra time to reach your\ndestination.\n\nThe snow will taper to lighter snow and possibly some freezing\ndrizzle after midnight.",
