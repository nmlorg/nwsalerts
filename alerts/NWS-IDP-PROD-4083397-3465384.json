Much of the cause behind this event can be\nattributed to ice covering the river. As the river rises, the risk\nof ice becoming mobile increases, as will the risk of an ice jam. If\nan ice jam does occur, water levels could quickly rise and fall\nseveral feet within a few hours.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nthe Missouri River near Williston.\n* From this evening to Thursday, March 12.\n* At 6:45 PM CST Monday / 5:45 PM MST Monday the stage was 22.1 feet.\n* Flood stage is 22.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and will continue.\n* Forecast...The river is expected to rise to a crest of 23.5 feet\nearly Friday afternoon.\n* Impact...At 20.0 feet, Ditches in the vicinity of the river will\nfill and wildlife management lands along the south banks will\nbegin to flood.\n* Impact...At 22.0 feet, Low-lying farmland and access roads to oil\nwell sites near Trenton are flooded. City of Williston does not\nflood.\n* Impact...At 24.0 feet, Water begins to cover oil well location\nsouth and east of Williston. Wildlife management areas are\nflooded.
