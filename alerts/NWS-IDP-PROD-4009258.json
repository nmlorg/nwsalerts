        "description": "With the saturation in some places within the Lower Hudson Valley\nas well as Western Passaic New Jersey and Northern Fairfield\nConnecticut early this morning, some patchy freezing fog has\nformed. This can lead to patchy areas of black ice on untreated\nsurfaces. Patchy freezing fog is expected to last into mid\nmorning.\n\nIf going outdoors this morning and traveling, proceed with extra\ncaution as untreated surfaces will become slippery with any ice\nthat forms. Also, the fog in a few places will be dense and will\nresult in visibilities of less than one mile.\n\nExpect temperatures in these areas to rise above freezing between\n9 and 10 am with fog dissipating as well.",
