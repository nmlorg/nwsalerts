The area of greatest concern for the\nheaviest rainfall is over southern sections of southeast Missouri\nand western Kentucky.\n\nIt is too early to tell if widespread flooding will be an issue,\nhowever, confidence is increasing that smaller areas will see\noverland flooding. The best chance for flooding will in be\nlow-lying and poorly-drained areas. This includes low water\ncrossings. Small streams and rivers will also see rises.\n\nThose individuals and organizations with interests in flood-prone\nareas or along small streams should begin to prepare for the\nincreased flooding potential during the middle of next week.",
