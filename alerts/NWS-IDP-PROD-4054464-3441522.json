        "description": "...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS EXPECTED IN WESTERN MINNESOTA WEDNESDAY...\n...DANGEROUS WIND CHILLS EXPECTED WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH\nTHURSDAY MORNING...\n\n.A Blizzard Warning remains in effect for portions of west\ncentral and southwest Minnesota starting 6 am Wednesday morning,\nand continues through the afternoon. A Winter Storm Watch with\nblizzard conditions possible surround the blizzard warning in west\ncentral, southwest and south central Minnesota for the same time\nperiod. Wind Chill Warnings have been issued for west central\nthrough southwestern Minnesota, with Wind Chill Advisories issued\nfor east central Minnesota, portions of southeast Minnesota and\nfar western Wisconsin for Wednesday night into Thursday morning.\n\nConfidence has increased that portions of west central and\nsouthwest Minnesota, mainly west of a Morris to Redwood Falls to\nSt. James line, will have blizzard conditions developing behind a\nstrong Arctic front on Wednesday. The combination of strong gusty\nwinds and whiteout conditions will lead to blizzard conditions\nfor several hours. Confidence is lower on wind speeds farther to\nthe east and thus a Winter Storm Watch has been issued.\n\nOutside the warning and watch area, significant blowing and\ndrifting snow is likely, with locally one to two inches of snow by\nthe afternoon.\n\nIn addition to the blizzard conditions, temperatures will drop\noff sharply behind the Arctic front. Wind chill values will drop\n30 degrees below zero by the afternoon in west central Minnesota,\nwith wind chills likely dropping to 35 degrees below zero by the\nevening, persisting through Thursday morning. In eastern\nMinnesota into western Wisconsin, wind chills will drop to between\n25 and 35 degrees below zero late Wednesday night through\nThursday morning. Outside the warning and watch area, significant\nblowing and drifting snow is likely, with locally one to two\ninches of snow by the afternoon.\n\n* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind\nchills expected. Wind chills as low as 40 below zero. For the\nWinter Storm Watch, blizzard conditions possible. Total snow\naccumulations of up to one inch possible. Winds could gust as\nhigh as 35 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Sibley, Nicollet, Blue Earth and Faribault Counties.\n\n* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, from 5 AM to 10 AM CST\nThursday. For the Winter Storm Watch, from Wednesday morning\nthrough Wednesday afternoon.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing\nsnow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous\nconditions could impact the morning or evening commute. The\ndangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed\nskin in as little as 10 minutes.",
        "instruction": "Avoid outside activities if possible. When outside, make sure you\nwear appropriate clothing, a hat, and gloves.\n\nPrepare for possible blizzard conditions. Continue to monitor the\nlatest forecasts for updates on this situation.",
