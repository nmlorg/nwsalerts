        "instruction": "A Gale Warning means winds of 34 to 47 knots are imminent or\noccurring. Operating a vessel in gale conditions requires\nexperience and properly equipped vessels. It is highly\nrecommended that mariners without the proper experience seek safe\nharbor prior to the onset of gale conditions.\n\nA Small Craft Advisory means that wind speeds of 21 to 33 knots\nand/or seas 10 feet or higher are expected to produce hazardous\nwave conditions to small craft. Inexperienced mariners,\nespecially those operating smaller vessels should avoid\nnavigating in these conditions.",
