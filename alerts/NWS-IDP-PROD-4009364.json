While most of the accumulating snow is expected\nto remain above 1000 feet, there could be some slick surfaces at\nlower elevations during the morning commute.\n\nGive yourself extra travel time and distance between vehicles as\nroads may be icy; especially on secondary roads and overpasses in\noutlying areas. Remember to check tripcheck.com for up to date\nroad conditions in Oregon, and wsdot.com for Washington.",
