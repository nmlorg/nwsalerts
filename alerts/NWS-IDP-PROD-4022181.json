        "description": "Seasonably mild temperatures this week will cause areas of ice to\nbreak up on rivers and try to move downstream. This may lead to\nice jam flooding if ice gets piled up along river channels.\n\nOne particular area we are watching closely is in Yellowstone\nCounty. This is from the confluence of the Clarks Fork and\nYellowstone Rivers near Laurel, downstream to Duck Creek Bridge\nsouth of Billings. Water levels are approaching bank level in a\nfew locations along this stretch as ice piles up and could result\nin some minor flooding this week.\n\nThose living near waterways over the region should pay close\nattention to the state of the ice this week. Move livestock and\nequipment away from low lying areas, and be prepared to seek\nhigher ground should waters rise.\n\nIf ice jam flooding is observed, please report it to local law\nenforcement, and have them pass it on to the National Weather\nService.",
