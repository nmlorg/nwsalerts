A lull in\nprecipitation is expected late this afternoon through much of the\nevening before another round starts again around midnight.\n\nThe greatest threat for widespread snowfall continues to be\nfocused across the northwestern South Plains and southwestern\nTexas Panhandle where a Winter Storm Watch remains in effect.\nElsewhere, a mix of freezing rain, snow, and sleet is expected\novernight as colder air filters into the region from the\nnortheast.\n\nAnother lull in precipitation looks possible during the day on\nTuesday followed by a final round Tuesday evening which may\npresent an better chance of snow southeast of the current watch\narea.\n\nWe encourage all to stay abreast of the latest forecast watches\nand warnings tonight and tomorrow and consider if travel plans or\noutdoor activities should be modified.",
