Excessive runoff from these\nthunderstorms will cause small stream flooding. This means some\nlow water crossings in the region may become impassable.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nRowlett, Wylie, Rockwall, Greenville, Terrell, Seagoville, Forney,\nBonham, Commerce, Kaufman, Royse City, Heath, Princeton, Fate,\nFarmersville, Mabank, Crandall, Leonard, Combine and Honey Grove.",
