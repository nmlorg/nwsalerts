        "description": "A strong winter storm is expected to move across Eastern Utah and\nWestern Colorado starting Monday morning and persisting through\nTuesday afternoon. This potent system may bring moderate to heavy\nsnowfall to most mountain areas with the heaviest accumulations\nfavored over the eastern Uinta Mountains according to latest\nguidance. Peak snowfall rates are expected to occur Monday and\nMonday night, which could adversely impact travel.\n\nSome uncertainty remains on the exact track and strength of the\nsystem, but early indications are that a majority of the mountain\npasses will be impacted, especially on Monday. In addition to the\nheavy snow potential, wind gusts could reach 40 to 50 mph in the\nhighest elevations of the northern mountains resulting in low\nvisibility and drifting snow. Anyone planning to travel across\nEastern Utah or Western Colorado early next week should check for\nforecast updates on this evolving winter storm.",
