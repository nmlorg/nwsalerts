        "description": "Windy conditions, the potential for flash flooding, and coastal\nhazards will increase this weekend and will continue into next\nweek. The windy conditions have the potential to blow down trees,\ndown power lines, blow around loose objects, Damage roofs, small\nout-buildings, tents, and outdoor kitchen, travel will be\ndifficult especially for high profile vehicles. Frequent rain may\ncreate flash flooding to cause flooded roadways and overflowing\nstreams across the territory, landslides, and cause structures\nto be inundated. We expect hazardous seas which will create high\nsurf conditions along with gale force winds along American Samoa\ncoastal waters. These conditions will be hazardous to small\ncrafts, cause strong rip currents, and may capsize or damage\nvessels.\n\nAmerican Samoa is in the middle of hurricane season. It is\nimportant to actively listen for forthcoming information from your\nNational Weather Service Office and TEMCO for latest information.\nYou may also contact EOC at 699-3800 for more precautionary and\npreparedness actions.
