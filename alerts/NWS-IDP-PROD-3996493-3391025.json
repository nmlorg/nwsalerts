Conditions will be favorable for showers and\nstorms to repeatedly track across the same region during the\nevening hours. This will result in a corridor of heavy rainfall\ntotals. A swath of 2 to 4 inch rains is expected, especially\nsoutheast of Interstate 44. Isolated locations from far\nsoutheast Oklahoma into far northwest Arkansas may receive as\nmuch as 5 to 6 inches of rain before sunrise Saturday.\n\n* Soil conditions will quickly become saturated and allow for a\nquick transition toward runoff from the heavy rains. This will\nraise the potential for rapid onset flooding, and also\ncontribute to more substantial rises on area main stem rivers.\nRiver flood warnings are currently in effect for the\nexpectation of substantial river rises.",
