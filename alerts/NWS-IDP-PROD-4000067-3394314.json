Around 2 inches of rain fell in a brief period of\ntime, inundating some low-lying roads, making them impassable. Light\nto moderate rain will continue through the remainder of the night\nbut floodwaters are expected to gradually recede.\n\nHAZARD...Flash flooding caused by heavy rain.\n\nSOURCE...Radar indicated.\n\nIMPACT...Flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,\nhighways, streets and underpasses as well as other drainage\nand low lying areas.\n\nSome locations that will experience flooding include...\nJonesboro, Bono, Bay, Brookland, Hergett, Apt, Herman, Valley View,\nFarrville, Gilkerson, Otwell, Cary, Herndon, Goobertown, Needham and\nCraighead Forest Park.",
