        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nEast Fork White River...Eel River...Wabash River...White River...\n\n\n.Minor to moderate flooding continued Sunday morning in central and\nsouthern Indiana on the major rivers.  Crests will be/are comparable\nto those that occurred in February and June of 2019.  Minor\nflooding developed late Saturday afternoon on the Eel River that\nwill come to an end this afternoon.\n\nA mix of precipitation Friday and Saturday totaled as high as\napproximately 1.50 inches, which will slow river falls or bring\nlower secondary crests on the major rivers, and produce additional\nminor flooding on smaller ones.  Flooding has returned to Seymour on\nthe East Fork White River, and this afternoon it will return to\nSpencer on the White River.  The Driftwood River near Edinburgh will\nbe near bankfull, with a crest near flood stage Sunday morning.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers will\ncontinue until about Wednesday, January 29.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is forecast through midday Thursday.  This\nwill give area waterways several days to drain and return to near\nnormal levels.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Riverton.\n* until Tuesday January 28.\n* At 9:00 AM Sunday the stage was 20.7 feet.\n* Flood stage is 15.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by Monday\nJanuary 27.\n* At 20.7 feet...Leaverton Park at Palestine, Illinois extensively\nfloods including the campground area.  Rodeo area still dry at this\nlevel. Most if not all local unimproved roads leading to the Wabash\nRiver in the Palestine area are impassable by any land vehicle.\nExtensive backwater flooding of Minnow Slough, Sugar Creek and\nLamotte Creek in Palestine area. Numerous river cabins surrounded\nby water across the river from Merom Bluff. Backyards of a few\nresidences southeast of Palestine along East River Road flood.",
