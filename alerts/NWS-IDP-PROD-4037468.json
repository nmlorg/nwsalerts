        "description": "A northwest flow of moisture will become established over Idaho by\nlate Wednesday morning and continue through Friday, resulting in\na long-duration snowfall event for portions of the Central\nMountains and Clark County. At this time, 3 day snow totals of 6\nto 12 inches are possible north of Galena Summit and west of\nChallis, with localized higher amounts in the Sawtooth Mountains.\nThe Wood River Valley, Big Lost River Valley, and Challis area\nwill be more shadowed and protected from the heavier snow, with\nonly a coating to a couple of inches expected through Friday. In\nClark County, accumulations may range from only an inch or two\nnear Dubois, to 6 inches or more near Monida Pass. Breezy\nconditions are also expected to develop from Wednesday afternoon\nthrough Friday afternoon, resulting in some blowing and drifting\nsnow.\n\nThere are still some uncertainties regarding snowfall amounts.\nContinue to monitor the latest forecasts and updates from the\nNational Weather Service in Pocatello, including possible watches,\nwarnings, or advisories. Begin planning now for a long period of\nvariable travel conditions including the potential for slick and\nsnow covered roads.",
