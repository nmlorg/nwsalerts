        "description": "Significantly above normal rainfall amounts have been\nexperienced across Middle Tennessee this year. As of this\nmorning, Nashville International Airport is around 8 inches above\nnormal and Crossville Memorial Airport is more than 9 inches\nabove normal.\n\nThe next wave of potentially heavy rainfall will be from Sunday\nnight through Wednesday of next week. It looks like the heaviest\nbands of rainfall could produce five to seven inches of rainfall,\nbut there is still a significant amount of uncertainty where that\nband will set up. For other locations across the mid state, at\nleast 2 to 3 inches of rainfall accumulation during this time\nframe is expected. The bulk of this rainfall is expected Tuesday\ninto Tuesday night.\n\nThese forecast rainfall amounts, combined with already saturated\nground conditions, will likely lead to flooding along rivers,\ncreeks, streams, roadways, low lying areas, and other poor\ndrainage locations by Tuesday evening and last through the rest of\nthe week.\n\nResidents throughout Middle Tennessee should continue to closely\nmonitor latest forecasts concerning heavy rainfall and flood\npotential this weekend.
