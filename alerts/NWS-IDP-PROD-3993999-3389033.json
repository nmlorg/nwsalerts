Visibilities below a quarter mile can be\nexpected with snow will rapidly accumulate on roadways, leading to\ntrechorous driving conditions.\n\nHAZARD...Snow and blowing snow. Wind gusts up to 30 mph.\n\nSOURCE...Radar indicated.\n\nIMPACT...Expect hazardous road conditions.\n\nThis includes the following highways...\nInterstate 89 between mile markers 0 and 3.\nInterstate 93 between mile markers 34 and 43.\nInterstate 95 between mile markers 1 and 16.\nInterstate 95 in New Hampshire between mile markers 2 and 16.\n\nThis also includes...\nHampton Beach, York Beach, and Ogunquit Beach.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nConcord, Rochester, Portsmouth, Hampton, Durham, Exeter, Kittery,\nNorthwood, Dover, Hooksett, Somersworth, Barrington, Berwick,\nFarmington, Epping, Lebanon, Loudon, Alton, Barnstead and Epsom.",
        "instruction": "Travel is not advised during this dangerous snow squall.  Rapid\nvisibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to lead to\naccidents.  Consider delaying travel until the squall passes your\nlocation.  If traveling, pull off to a safe location and turn your\nheadlights on.\n\nTemperatures are above freezing, but sharply colder temperatures\nfollowing the snow will cause any water or slush to quickly freeze on\nroads and sidewalks.  Untreated road surfaces will become extremely\nslippery.  Reduced speeds and increased distance between vechicles is\nadvised.",
