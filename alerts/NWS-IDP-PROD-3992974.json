        "description": "Multiple rounds of rainfall are expected Thursday afternoon\nthrough Saturday morning across the bi-state area. Currently, the\nheaviest period of rain along with a few thunderstorms is\nexpected to be from late Friday afternoon into early Saturday\nmorning. By the time the precipitation ends late Saturday, 2 to 4\ninches are expected. The highest amounts are forecast to be across\nportions of east-central and southeastern Missouri as well as\nwestern Illinois where locally higher amounts in excess of 4\ninches are possible.\n\nThis prolonged period of wet weather will lead to rises on most area\nrivers. Renewed river flooding is possible across much of the\narea, but most likely along the Black River in southeast Missouri\nand the Kaskaskia River in Illinois. In addition to the possible\nriver flooding, flash flooding may be possible Friday night and\nearly Saturday morning due to the potential for high rainfall\nrates to fall on already saturated soils.\n\nBe sure to remain up to date with the latest river forecasts, and\npossible warnings, especially if you live along a river or other\nflood prone location.",
