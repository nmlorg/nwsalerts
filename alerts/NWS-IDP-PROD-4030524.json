Visibilities will be reduced to one\nquarter of a mile or less, and due to subfreezing temperatures, a\nthin glaze of ice may develop on elevated surfaces such as cars,\nbridges and overpasses.\n\nMotorists are urged to drive with extreme caution, as visibilities\nwill vary significantly. Use low beams, reduce driving speed, and\nallow for plenty of room between you and other cars.\n\nThe fog should dissipate between 11 AM and Noon CST.\n\nStay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio, or a favorite local media outlet,\nfor further statements or updates from the National Weather Service\nin Huntsville.",
