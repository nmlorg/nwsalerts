Total snow accumulations of 2 to 5 inches,\nbut 6 to 10 inches along the east slopes of the Sangre De\nCristos.\n\n* WHERE...East Slopes Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Central\nHighlands, South Central Mountains, Johnson and Bartlett Mesas\nIncluding Raton Pass, Far Northeast Highlands, Northeast\nHighlands, Harding County, Eastern San Miguel County,\nGuadalupe County and Southwest Chaves County.\n\n* WHEN...Until 8 PM MST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of falling and blowing snow\nwill reduce visibility below 1 mile.",
