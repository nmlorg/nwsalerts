The heavy rainfall will have the\npotential to produce flooding in many locations, with landslides\nalso possible in the mountains.\n\nThe Flash Flood Watch continues for\n\n* portions of northeast Georgia, North Carolina, and upstate\nSouth Carolina, including the following areas, in northeast\nGeorgia, Elbert, Franklin, Hart, and Stephens. In North\nCarolina, Alexander, Cabarrus, Catawba, Cleveland, Davie,\nEastern McDowell, Eastern Polk, Gaston, Greater Burke, Greater\nCaldwell, Greater Rutherford, Iredell, Lincoln, Mecklenburg,\nRowan, and Union NC. In upstate South Carolina, Abbeville,\nAnderson, Cherokee, Chester, Greater Greenville, Greater\nOconee, Greater Pickens, Greenville Mountains, Greenwood,\nLaurens, Oconee Mountains, Pickens Mountains, Spartanburg,\nUnion SC, and York.\n\n* through this evening\n\n* Widespread heavy rainfall is already occurring across the region\nthis morning. The rainfall will increase in intensity today, and\nrainfall rates up to one inch per hour will be likely in the\nheaviest showers and thunderstorms. This could cause flooding to\ndevelop rapidly in low-lying areas.\n\n* Rapid rises above bankfull along streams and creeks are likely\nto occur, along with the threat of flooded roads. Flooding is\nalso likely to occur on larger rivers, and this flooding would\nlinger through Friday or beyond. Storm total rainfall through\nThursday evening may be as much as 2 to 4 inches across the\narea, with locally higher amounts very near the mountains.",
