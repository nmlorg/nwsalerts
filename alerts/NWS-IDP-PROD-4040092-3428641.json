Due to saturated soils from previous rainfall, this slow\nmoving band of thunderstorms is expected to result in significant\nponding of water on roads and flooding. Up to two inches of rain\nhave already fallen, with additional rainfall amounts of two to\nthree inches per hour anticipated within the line of thunderstorms.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nFlorence, Muscle Shoals, Russellville, Sheffield, Tuscumbia,\nMoulton, Red Bay, Rogersville, Phil Campbell and Killen.",
