For the\nHeavy Freezing Spray Watch, heavy freezing spray at a rate of\n2 cm per hour or greater possible, and may rapidly accumulate\non vessels.\n\n* WHERE...Wind Point WI to Winthrop Harbor IL, North Point Light\nto Wind Point WI, Port Washington to North Point Light WI and\nSheboygan to Port Washington WI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, until 3 AM CST Sunday. For the\nHeavy Freezing Spray Watch, from Saturday afternoon through\nSunday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should consider altering plans to avoid or mitigate\nhazardous accumulation of ice on their vessel.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
