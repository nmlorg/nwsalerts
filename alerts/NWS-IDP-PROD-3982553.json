Any snow cover\nmay cause slippery road conditions especially where they are not\ntreated. There has also been a history of lightning with some of the\nsqualls as they crossed central Berkshire county.\n\nMotorists should use caution and slow down as this line of snow\napproaches.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nSpringfield, Chicopee, Enfield, Westfield, Holyoke, Amherst,\nWindsor, Northampton, Agawam, West Springfield, Greenfield,\nDeerfield, Simsbury, Ludlow, Bloomfield, Avon, South Hadley,\nEasthampton, Longmeadow and Suffield.",
