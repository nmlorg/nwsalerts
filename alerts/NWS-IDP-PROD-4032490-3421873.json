River are expected to rise, with some rivers\nreaching flood stage as early as Friday evening. Snow levels\nwill be around 6,000 to 8,000 feet tonight through Friday night.\nHeavy rainfall may also cause periods of minor urban flooding.\nThe exact placement of heaviest rainfall remains uncertain and\nwill have a direct influence on the magnitude and placement of\nflooding. Widespread minor to moderate river flooding is most\nlikely, but major flooding is also possible. Rivers from King\nCounty northward are at greatest risk of reaching moderate to\nmajor flood severity.",
