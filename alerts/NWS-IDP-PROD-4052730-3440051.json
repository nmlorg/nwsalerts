The estimated flood stage is 16 feet. The creek\nis expected to crest late this evening around 16.5 feet and then\nslowly fall overnight. At stages near 16 feet, fields and low and\npoor drainage areas along the creek and associated tributaries\nbegin to flood. In addition, the higher water levels should\ncontinue downstream overnight and eventually cause the Middle\nIsland Creek at Little to rise above flood stage. At 930 PM EST,\nthe stage of Middle Island Creek at Little was 13.09 feet. The\nestimated flood stage is 14 feet. The creek is expected to crest\nlate tonight around 14 feet and then slowly fall. At stages near\n14 feet, the lower fields begin to flood and Stewarts Run Road\nbecomes flooded.\n\nSome locations that will experience flooding include...\nMiddlebourne, Little, and other low and poor drainage areas along\nand near Middle Island Creek.",
