Strong south winds ahead of the storm will tap moisture\nfrom the Gulf of Mexico and produce a period of heavy rainfall\nacross central and southeast Illinois\n\nThe Flood Watch continues for\n\n* Portions of central Illinois, east central Illinois, southeast\nIllinois, and west central Illinois, including the following\nareas, in central Illinois, Christian, De Witt, Logan, Macon,\nMenard, Piatt, Sangamon, and Shelby. In east central Illinois,\nChampaign, Clark, Coles, Cumberland, Douglas, Edgar, Moultrie,\nand Vermilion. In southeast Illinois, Clay, Crawford,\nEffingham, Jasper, Lawrence, and Richland. In west central\nIllinois, Cass, Morgan, and Scott.\n\n* From 6 PM CST this evening through Saturday morning\n\n* Heavy rainfall from last weekend has resulted in saturated soil\nconditions and river and lake levels being higher than normal.\nBy Saturday morning some areas will receive between 1 and 1.5\ninches. The precipitation will start out as a wintry mix during\nthis afternoon and into part of this evening. As warmer air\nmoves in from the south, the precipitation will change over to\nrain during the evening. Most of the moderate to heavy rain is\nexpected tonight after temperatures are above freezing. This\nrainfall will quickly become runoff.\n\n* Moderate to heavy rainfall will result in flooding of low\nlying or poor drainage areas, including flooding on smaller creeks\nand streams. Significant rises on larger streams and rivers will\nalso be possible.",
