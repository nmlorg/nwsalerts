Snow, possibly mixed with rain initially, and\nstrong northwest winds gusting to 40 mph, will accompany the front\nas it moves southeast. Temperatures in the middle 30s as the\nfront arrives will cause precipitation to melt initially, with\ntemperatures falling rapidly into the 20s by early afternoon.

Also, snow and blowing snow with the\nstrong northwest winds will cause greatly reduced visibilities.\n\n* WHAT...Snow, blowing snow and flash freeze expected. Total snow\naccumulations of up to one inch, visibilities of a half mile,\nand ice accumulation of a light glaze. Winds gusting as high as\n40 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of northeast Nebraska and west central Iowa.\n\n* WHEN...From 9 AM to 6 PM CST Wednesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions and reduced\nvisibilities.
