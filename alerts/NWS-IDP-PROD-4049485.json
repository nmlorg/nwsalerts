        "description": "Several rounds of heavy rainfall are expected between Monday and\nThursday as a series of disturbances interact with a stalled\nfrontal boundary. Thunderstorms are also expected during this\ntime and will locally increase rainfall amounts. The combination\nof saturated soils from recent rainfall, and still swollen\nrivers, creeks, and streams, will increase the threat for\nflooding.\n\nRainfall totals Monday and Tuesday could reach 2.5 to 4 inches,\nwith locally higher amounts up to 5 inches possible. Another 2 to\n3 inches of rain will be possible Wednesday and Thursday as\nanother frontal system impacts the region. It is important to note\nthat these values may change depending on exactly where the front\nstalls.\n\nA Flood Watch is in effect for the entire Tennessee Valley region\nfrom 6 AM Monday to 6 PM Tuesday. Residents should continue to\nmonitor this unfolding weather situation and stay tuned to\nfurther forecast updates from the National Weather Service.\n\nFor additional hydrologic information, visit our website at\nweather.gov/huntsville.",
