Tropical Depression 09F (97P) is passing within 75 miles\nwest of Tutuila this morning and is expected to intensify as it\ntracks south of Tutuila later today and tonight. A complex\nenvironment within the active monsoon trough may bring another\nsystem near Samoa on Friday.\n\nA Gale warning means sustained winds of 34-47 kts (39-54 mph),\nis either predicted or occurring, and not directly associated\nwith a tropical cyclone.\n\nGale force winds and elevated seas could capsize or damage\nvessels and the frequent showers could reduce visibility.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible hazardous\nconditions. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or\nsecure the vessel for severe wind and seas.\n\nListen to NOAA Weather Radio for the latest updates.\n\nYou may also follow us on Facebook \"NWSPagoPago\" or our website\nat www.weather.gov/ppg.",
