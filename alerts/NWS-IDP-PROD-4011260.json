The peak snowfall rates look to occur\non Friday morning, which could impact travel.\n\nSome uncertainty remains on the exact track and strength of the\nsystem, but early indications are that a majority of the mountain\npasses will be impacted, especially Friday. In addition to the\nheavy snow potential wind gusts could reach 40-60 mph in the\nhighest elevations causing low visibility and drifting snow.\nAnyone planning to travel across Eastern Utah or Western Colorado\nshould monitor the latest forecast as this winter storm moves into\nthe region.",
