This storm\nwill start as snow, but surface temperatures may warm up just\nenough to convert the precipitation type to rain or a rain/snow\nmix by the afternoon hours.

In addition, with temperatues falling quickly tonight,\nany wet surfaces and roadways are expected to flash freeze and\ncause further travel issues.\n\n* WHAT...Very cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as low as\n15 to 25 below zero.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of northeast Kansas and north central and\nnorthwest Missouri.\n\n* WHEN...From midnight tonight to noon CST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...The cold wind chills could cause frostbite on\nexposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Roadways may remain slick overnight into\nThursday as temperatures remain well below freezing.",
