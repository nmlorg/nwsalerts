        "description": "Confidence remains high for heavy rainfall, mainly from Friday\nnight into Saturday. Storm total rainfall from Thursday night\nthrough Saturday is expected to average from two to four inches\nalong and southeast of the Ohio River. Although rain will start on\nThursday night, the concerns with heavy rainfall begin late\nFriday and continue through Saturday.\n\nThe ground is already moist ahead of this upcoming rain system.\nTherefore, flooding issues are likely to develop rather quickly.\nFlooding of low-lying and poorly drained areas, as well as low\nwater crossings, can be expected. Where the heaviest rains occur,\nmore significant flooding problems may develop. A Flood Watch may\nbe issued late tonight or Thursday.\n\nWater levels are already high on the Ohio River and some of its\ntributaries, and the additional rainfall could lead to renewed\nflooding next week. In addition, other rivers may rise above flood\nstage throughout the area.\n\nIndividuals, businesses, and government agencies with interests\nin or near flood prone areas should review their preparedness\nplans for potential flooding later this week.\n\nPlease stay tuned to the latest forecasts of this potentially\nsignificant heavy rainfall and flooding event.",
