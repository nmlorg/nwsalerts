The Driftwood River near Edinburgh will be near\nbankfull, with a crest near flood stage Sunday morning.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers\nwill continue until about Wednesday, January 29.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is forecast through midday Thursday.\nThis will give area waterways several days to drain and return to\nnear normal levels.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River at Hazleton.\n* until Wednesday January 29.\n* There have been no observations in the last 24 hours.\n* Flood stage is 16.0 feet.\n* Moderate flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It is forecast to crest at 25.4 feet late tonight and\nwill fall below flood stage by Tuesday January 28.\n* At 25.0 feet...Extensive river flooding continues in northern Gibson\nCounty.
