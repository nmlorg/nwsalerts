        "description": "Snow will overspread the area this morning. At 600 am, the leading\nedge of the snow extended from Eau Claire, to the Wisconsin\nDells, to near Milwaukee. The snow was advancing rapidly east, and\nshould begin in central Wisconsin by 800 am, and in northern and\neastern Wisconsin by late morning.\n\nOnce the snow begins, it will rapidly become heavy in central and\neast-central Wisconsin. Snowfall rates of 1 inch per hour are\nlikely in these areas, with rates approaching 2 inches per hour\npossible. The heaviest snow will move through through central\nWisconsin between about 900 am and noon, and and through east-\ncentral Wisconsin during the late morning and early afternoon\nhours. A few flashes of lightning and claps of thunder could\naccompany the heavy snow.\n\nThe snow will continue into the afternoon, though snowfall rates\nwill be lower than with the initial burst of heavy snow. Snow\nwill begin to diminish to flurries across central Wisconsin toward\ndusk and in eastern Wisconsin during the early to middle evening.\nThe total snowfall from the storm is expected to range from\naround an inch in far northern Vilas county, to 6 to 10 inches\nacross central and east-central Wisconsin.\n\nTravel conditions are likely to deteriorate quickly this morning\ndue to the snow. Although winds are not expected to be strong with\nthis storm, the visibility in central and east-central Wisconsin\nwill also be significantly reduced at times due to the falling\nsnow. Be sure to allow plenty of time to reach your destination\nif you are traveling today.",
