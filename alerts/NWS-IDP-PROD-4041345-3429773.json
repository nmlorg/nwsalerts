Periods of heavy\nshowers and a few thunderstorms will continue to develop across\nthe region through the morning, with an additional 1 to 3 inches\nof rain probable, especially along favored slopes and the high\nterrain, where rainfall totals may approach 6 inches.\n\nHAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.\n\nSOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.\n\nIMPACT...Flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,\nhighways, streets and underpasses as well as other\ndrainage and low lying areas.",

Low-water crossings\ncan be submerged by flood waters quickly and without warning. Never\nattempt to travel across flooded crossings. Find an alternate route.\nIt takes only a few inches of swiftly flowing water to carry vehicles\naway.\n\nThe additional heavy rain will increase the risk of landslides,\nespecially in areas where slides have occurred in the past. Be\nespecially alert if you are near a stream, especially at the base of\na mountain or in a cove. Watch for loose-moving soil and rocks or a\nsudden increase in streamflow. Leave the area quickly if this is\nobserved. When driving along roads where the terrain is steep or\nrocky, watch and listen for falling rocks, mud, trees and other\ndebris.",
