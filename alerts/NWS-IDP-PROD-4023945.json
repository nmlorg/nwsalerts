Although snow and ice\naccumulations are light, roads are quickly becoming covered with snow\nand ice, resulting in slippery travel for the morning commute.\nSlide offs have already been reported in some areas.\n\nPlan ahead for a slower, slippery drive this morning. Slow down on\nsnow and ice covered roads and allow extra time to reach your\ndestination.",
