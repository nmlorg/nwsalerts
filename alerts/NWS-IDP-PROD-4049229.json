The greatest potential for\ncoastal flooding impacts will be during the peak daily high tide,\nwhich will occur during the early morning hours between midnight\nand daybreak.\n\nCoastal impacts may include significant beach erosion, flooding\nof beaches that normally remain dry and overwash onto vulnerable\nlow-lying coastal roads and other coastal infrastructure.\n\nPay attention to later forecasts for updated information. Listen\nfor any watches, warnings, or advisories that may be needed for\nthis event.",
