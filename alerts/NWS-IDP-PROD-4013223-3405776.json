        "description": "...STRONG WINDS AND AREAS OF HEAVY FREEZING SPRAY THIS MORNING...\n\n.Strong downslope winds will continue over portions of the North\nShore waters early this morning. Gales of 35 to 40 knots are\nexpected from Taconite Harbor to Grand Portage, MN. The strong\nwinds will result in building waves over the North Shore waters\nand heavy freezing spray will likely accompany those strong winds.\nConditions will remain hazardous to smaller vessels for the\nwaters except from Two Harbors to Duluth, MN to Port Wing, WI.\nHeavy freezing spray is also likely from Port Wing to Bayfield, WI\ndue to the combination of Arctic air, strong winds, and building\nwaves. Wind and waves will subside later this morning as high\npressure moves into the region.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy freezing spray at a rate of 2 cm per hour or\ngreater may rapidly accumulate on vessels. Northwest winds 15 to\n25 knots with occasional gusts to 35 knots and waves 1 to 4\nfeet.\n\n* WHERE...Taconite Harbor to Silver Bay Harbor MN.\n\n* WHEN...Until 9 AM CST this morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of stability.\nConditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nAnyone operating a smaller vessel should avoid navigating in\nhazardous conditions.",
