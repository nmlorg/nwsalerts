At Cascade, the river\nhas risen to 12.13-ft as of 1130 pm Tuesday evening, which is\none-half foot higher than the level reached in March 2019 when\nice jam flooding occurred. Minor flooding may already be\noccurring along and upstream of Cascade. Meanwhile, at Great\nFalls the river level remains between 15 and 16 feet. Minor\nimpacts to low-lying parts of the River's Edge Trail, and\nRiverside Park near the Central Avenue Bridge, are either\noccurring or may still occur.\n\n* At Great Falls, ice and river water may continue to push onto\nthe river banks near Riverside Park, as well as along and\nupstream of the river near Cascade. Flooding could begin to\nimpact River Drive between the 10th Avenue Bridge and Broadwater\nBay Park, along with continued impacts to low-lying parts of the\nRiver's Edge Trail and Riverside Park near the Central Avenue\nbridge. Near and upstream of Cascade, ice and river water may\nbegin to push onto the river banks and cause flooding of low-\nlying areas, including some roads and personal property.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
