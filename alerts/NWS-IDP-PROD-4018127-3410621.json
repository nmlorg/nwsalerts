For the Gale Warning,\nwest winds increasing to gales to 40 knots this afternoon and\ntonight. Waves 8 to 12 feet occasionally to 16 feet, building\nto 12 to 16 feet occasionally to 21 feet.\n\n* WHERE...Lake Michigan from Sturgeon Bay WI to Point Betsie MI\nsouthward.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 6 PM this\nevening to noon CST Sunday. For the Gale Warning, until 6 AM\nCST Sunday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of stability.\nStrong winds will cause hazardous waves which could capsize or\ndamage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
