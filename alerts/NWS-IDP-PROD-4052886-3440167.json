This will cause urban and small stream flooding in\nthe advisory area. Up to three inches of rain have already fallen\nthroughout much of the day, with additional moderate rainfall over\nthe next several hours. This could lead to additional localized\nflooding into the overnight hours.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nGadsden, Rainbow City, Oneonta, Attalla, Hokes Bluff, Centre, Cedar\nBluff, Blountsville, Cleveland, Little River Canyon National\nPreserve, Forney, Centre Municipal Airport, Dallas, Glencoe,\nWarrior, Sardis City, Locust Fork, Leesburg, Altoona and Snead.",

Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nBe especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the\ndangers of flooding.\n\nIn hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are\npotentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to cross flooded\nroads. Find an alternate route.",
