Snowfall rates may reach an inch per\nhour with visibility reduced to under one quarter mile at times.\nRoads quickly will become snow covered and travel hazardous with\nthe onset of the snow.\n\nA light wintry mix will occur behind the initial band of snow this\nevening and tonight, with light snow and ice accumulations\npossible. As the storm departs the region on Saturday, strong\nnorthwest winds will produce areas of blowing and drifting snow,\nespecially across northeast Iowa and southeast Minnesota along\nwith the higher terrain locations of western Wisconsin. Rapidly\ncooling temperatures will also cause wet roads to freeze during\nthe day.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow through this evening changing to a light\nwintry mix overnight and then light snow Saturday. Total snow\naccumulations of 5 to 7 inches and ice accumulations of a light\nglaze. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Taylor and Clark Counties.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow\ncould significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions\nwill impact the Friday evening commute.",
