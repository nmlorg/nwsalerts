        "description": "* WHAT...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, heavy freezing\nspray at a rate of 2 cm per hour or greater expected, and may\nrapidly accumulate on vessels. For the Gale Warning, northwest\nwinds 20 to 30 kt with gusts up to 35 kt and waves 7 to 12\nfeet expected. For the Small Craft Advisory, southwest winds\n15 to 25 kt with gusts up to 30 kt and waves 4 to 7 feet\noccurring.\n\n* WHERE...Huron Islands to Marquette MI, Marquette to Munising\nMI, Munising to Grand Marais MI and Grand Marais to Whitefish\nPoint MI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 7 PM Tuesday\nto 10 AM EST Wednesday. For the Gale Warning, from 11 AM\nTuesday to 9 AM EST Wednesday. For the Small Craft Advisory,\nuntil 11 AM EST Tuesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of stability.\nStrong winds will cause hazardous waves which could capsize or\ndamage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
