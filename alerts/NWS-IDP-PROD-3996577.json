        "description": "Any remaining water on area roadways and sidewalks may refreeze\nthis morning across much of the area. This will lead to slippery\nspots on untreated surfaces, which may impact the morning commute.\n\nLight to moderate snow is expected to develop this evening and\nthen linger through much of tonight. Snowfall totals are generally\nexpected to be in the 1 to 3 inch range across the area, with the\ngreatest totals expected from the Fox Valley to the lakeshore. In\naddition, winds may gust as high as 30 mph late tonight, which\nwill likely lead to reduced visibilities at times.\n\nPlease allow extra time to reach your destination if traveling\nthis morning or tonight and be alert for rapidly changing road\nconditions due to black ice or snow covered roads.",
