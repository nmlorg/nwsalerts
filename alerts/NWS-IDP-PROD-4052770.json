        "description": "Patchy dense fog will continue to develop across portions of the\nupper Hudson Valley, including the Lake George Saratoga region,\nand southern Vermont, especially eastern Windham County, where\nsome visibilities may drop to under one quarter of a mile.\n\nIn addition, many ground surfaces remain wet from snow which\nmelted during the daytime. However, as temperatures continue\ndropping below freezing, patchy black ice may form, especially on\nuntreated ground surfaces including roadways, driveways and\nparking lots.\n\nMotorists and pedestrians should use extra caution overnight, as\nground surfaces which look wet may actually be ice covered and\nextremely slippery. Motorists should also remain vigilant to rapid\nreductions in visibility, which could drop to near zero in\nisolated areas.",
