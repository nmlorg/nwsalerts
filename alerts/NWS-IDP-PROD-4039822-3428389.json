Rainfall amounts\nso far have ranged upwards of two inches. Another two to three\ninches, with locally higher amounts is expected into Thursday\nafternoon. Runoff from excessive rains could produce flash\nflooding, as well as rises in area rivers, creeks, and streams.\n\nThe Flash Flood Watch is now in effect for\n\n* Portions of Alabama and southern middle Tennessee, including\nthe following areas, in Alabama, Cullman, DeKalb, Jackson,\nLimestone, Madison, Marshall, and Morgan. In southern middle\nTennessee, Franklin TN, Lincoln, and Moore.\n\n* Through Thursday afternoon\n\n* Multiple episodes of showers and thunderstorms producing heavy\nrainfall will occur across the region through Wednesday\nmorning. Due to moist soil conditions, this will result in\nefficient runoff and the potential for rapidly rising and\nswiftly flowing flood waters.",
