Rainfall amounts\nso far have ranged upwards of two inches. Another two to three\ninches, with locally higher amounts is expected into Thursday\nafternoon. Runoff from excessive rains could produce flash\nflooding, as well as rises in area rivers, creeks, and streams.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Huntsville has expanded the\n\n* Flash Flood Watch to include a portion of northwest Alabama,\nincluding the following areas, Colbert, Franklin AL,\nLauderdale, and Lawrence.\n\n* Through Thursday afternoon\n\n* Multiple episodes of showers and thunderstorms producing heavy\nrainfall will occur across the region through Wednesday\nmorning. Due to moist soil conditions, this will result in\nefficient runoff and the potential for rapidly rising and\nswiftly flowing flood waters.",
