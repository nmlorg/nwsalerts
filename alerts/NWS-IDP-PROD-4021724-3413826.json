For the\nGale Watch, from late tonight through Tuesday afternoon.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of stability.\nStrong winds can cause hazardous waves which could capsize or\ndamage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible\nhazardous conditions.  Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter\ncourse, and/or secure the vessel for severe wind and waves.",
