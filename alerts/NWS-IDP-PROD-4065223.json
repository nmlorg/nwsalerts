        "description": "Gale force winds of 30 to 40 kts continue to threaten the coastal\nwaters extending 40 nautical mile from Tutuila through Tuesday,\nas a complex environment within the active monsoon trough keeps\nthe possibility of a tropical cyclone developing near the\nislands. Seas of 16 to 21 feet or higher will remain through\nTuesday, with higher seas near thunderstorms.\n\nA gale warning means sustained winds of 34-47 kts (39-54 mph)\nis either predicted or occurring, and not directly associated\nwith a tropical cyclone.\n\nGale force winds and dangerous seas could capsize or damage\nvessels and the frequent showers could reduce visibility.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible hazardous\nconditions. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or\nsecure the vessel for severe wind and seas.\n\nListen to NOAA Weather Radio for the latest updates.\n\nYou may also follow us on Facebook \"NWSPagoPago\" or our website\nat www.weather.gov/ppg.",
