Snow may melt on road surfaces and\nrefreeze after sunset.\n\nHAZARD...Snow and blowing snow. Wind gusts up to 30 mph.\n\nSOURCE...Radar indicated.\n\nIMPACT...Expect hazardous road conditions.\n\nThis includes the following highways...\nInterstate 89 between mile markers 0 and 5.\nInterstate 93 between mile markers 29 and 74.\n\nThis also includes...\nMount Kearsage.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nConcord, Laconia, Franklin, New London, Meredith, Northwood,\nHooksett, Farmington, Hopkinton, Loudon, Alton, Barnstead, Epsom,\nGilmanton, Canterbury, Holderness, Ashland, Danbury, Warner and Bow.",
        "instruction": "Travel is not advised during this dangerous snow squall.  Rapid\nvisibility reduction and potentially icy roads are likely to lead to\naccidents.  Consider delaying travel until the squall passes your\nlocation.  If traveling, pull off to a safe location and turn your\nheadlights on.\n\nTemperatures are above freezing, but sharply colder temperatures\nfollowing the snow will cause any water or slush to quickly freeze on\nroads and sidewalks.  Untreated road surfaces will become extremely\nslippery.  Reduced speeds and increased distance between vechicles is\nadvised.",
