As the storm departs the region on Saturday, strong\nnorthwest winds will produce areas of blowing and drifting snow,\nespecially across northeast Iowa and southeast Minnesota along\nwith the higher terrain locations of western Wisconsin. Rapidly\ncooling temperatures will also cause wet roads to freeze during\nthe day.\n\n* WHAT...Snow this afternoon changing to a light wintry mix\novernight and then light snow Saturday. Total snow accumulations\nof 3 to 5 inches and ice accumulations of up to one tenth of an\ninch. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of central, southwest and west central\nWisconsin, northeast Iowa and southeast Minnesota.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
