Behind the front, already gusty\nwinds will increase to 25 to 35 mph with gusts approaching 45 mph.\nIn addition, temperatures will begin to fall rapidly likely\nallowing area roadways and walkways to freeze up from the water\nthat collected on them from last night's rain and melting sleet\nand snow. Untreated roads will likely become slick quickly and\ncombined with the strong winds driving will be hazardous.\n\nAlthough the temperatures will fall quickly, the windchill will\nfall even faster. By 6 pm, windchills are expected to be below\nzero north of I-72/Danville.\n\nBe prepared for deteriorating driving conditions today and plan\nfor falling temperature and windchill this afternoon.",
