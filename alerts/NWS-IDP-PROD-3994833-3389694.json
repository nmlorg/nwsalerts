While showers will be\npossible over most areas, the areas most susceptible to flooding\nwill be windward locations which have already received rain\nthis week.\n\n* The extended period of rain could cause flooding in low spots\nwhich could make some roadways impassable. Debris in streams\nand gulches may clog bridges and culverts. Strong winds may\ncause tree branches to fall which will potentially add to the\namount of debris.",
        "instruction": "A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions are favorable for flash\nflooding. Flash flooding is LIFE THREATENING. Do not cross fast\nflowing water in your vehicle or on foot.\n\nMonitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action if a Flash\nFlood Warning is issued. If you experience heavy rain or rising\nwater, head to higher ground immediately.",
