This threat will be maximized on\nsteeply sloped beaches. Rip currents can pull swimmers and\nsurfers out to sea. Large breaking waves can cause injury,\nwash people off beaches and rocks, and capsize small boats\nnear shore.",

Rock jetties can be deadly in\nsuch conditions, stay off the rocks.\n\nIf caught in a rip current, relax and float. Don't swim against\nthe current. If able, swim in a direction following the\nshoreline. If unable to escape, face the shore and call or wave\nfor help.",
