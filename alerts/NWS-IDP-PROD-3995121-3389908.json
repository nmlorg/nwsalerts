In addition, some\nof the rainfall may freeze up, and therefore not get into the river\nsystem.\n\nIf rainfall actually getting into the basin is less than predicted,\nthe forecast river stage may not be reached. Conversely, if rainfall\ngetting into the river basin is more than predicted the river may\ncrest higher.\n\nAs the forecast becomes more certain, this watch will either be\nupgraded to a warning or cancelled.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Quad Cities has issued a\n* Flood Watch for\nThe La Moine River at Colmar\n* Until Monday evening.\n* At  9:45 AM Thursday the stage was 5.6 feet.\n* Flood stage is 20.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is possible.\n* Forecast, rise above flood stage Sunday morning, and continue\nrising to 21.5 feet late Sunday night.\n* This forecast is based on forecast rainfall getting into the\nriver system. Consequently, there is limited confidence in\nthe river reaching flood stage.",
