        "description": "An arctic cold front was dropping south across northern Wisconsin,\nbringing a round of light snow. Most locations should see an inch\nor two of snow before tapering off to scattered flurries later\nthis evening, except for snow showers continuing across Vilas\nCounty. The combination of the falling snow, along with melting\nsnow from this afternoon and falling air temperatures well below\nfreezing could lead to a flash freeze this evening. Gusty northerly\nwinds may also create some areas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nOvernight, temperatures are expected to fall into the single\ndigits below zero. The combination of the cold temperatures and\ngusty northerly winds will produce wind chill readings in the\n15 below to 25 below zero range late tonight into Thursday\nmorning. Wind chill readings this low can produce frost bite\nwithin 30 minutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving this evening as\nroads will be slippery due to ice and snow. If venturing outdoors,\nwear layers of clothing along with a hat and gloves to protect\nyourself from the bitter cold.",
