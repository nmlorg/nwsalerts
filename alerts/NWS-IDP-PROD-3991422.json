        "description": "Multiple rounds of rainfall are very likely Thursday through\nSaturday morning across the bi-state area. Currently, the heaviest\nperiod of rain along with a few thunderstorms is expected to be\nfrom Friday night into early Saturday morning. By the time the\nprecipitation ends late Saturday, 1 to 3 inches are expected. The\nhighest amounts are forecast to be across portions of southeast\nMissouri and southwest Illinois where locally higher amounts above\n3 inches are possible.\n\nThis prolonged period of wet weather will lead to rises on some area\nrivers. Renewed river flooding is possible across southeastern\nportions of the area, particularly along the Black River in\nsoutheast Missouri and the Kaskaskia River in Illinois. In\naddition to the possible river flooding, flash flooding may be\npossible Friday night and early Saturday morning due to the\npotential for high rainfall rates to fall on already saturated\nsoils.\n\nBe sure to remain up to date with the latest river forecasts, and\npossible warnings, especially if you live along a river or other\nflood prone location.",
