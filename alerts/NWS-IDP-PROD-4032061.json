        "description": "An upper-level disturbance moving eastward across the region early\nthis morning continued to bring light snow to much of the region\nwest of the Blue Ridge. This will continue for a few more hours,\nthen diminish as the disturbance moves northeast of the region.\n\nSnow is generally very light and temperatures are only near or\nbelow freezing in the higher elevations west of the Blue Ridge\nwith temperatures above freezing for many locations east of the\nBlue Ridge, namely in the mid to upper 30s. Thus, snow accumulations\nare expected to remain light ranging from a dusting to perhaps an\ninch at some isolated higher elevations locations in the western\nmountains.\n\nEven though this is a light snow event and no advisories are\ncurrently in effect, light snow occurring around the rush hour\ncould result in unexpected traffic issues. In areas where\ntemperatures are near or below freezing, untreated roads,\nhighways, and sidewalks could become slick and hazardous this\nmorning, including during the morning commute. If you plan to\ntravel between now and 10 AM this morning, allow extra time to\nreach your destination, reduce speed, and use extra caution in\nareas where the roads are covered with snow.\n\nRoad and highway conditions will improve quickly once the snow\nends later this morning and temperatures warm above freezing.\n\nStay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio or commercial radio and\ntelevision for the latest weather information.",
