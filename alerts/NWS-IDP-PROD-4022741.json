        "description": "A weak storm system will bring gusty winds across the eastern\nSierra into western Nevada Today. Wind gusts of 35 to 45 mph are\nexpected across the Tahoe Basin and along the US-395 and I-580\ncorridor. A short period of stronger wind gusts over 50 mph are\npossible along the I-580/US-395 corridor between south Reno and\nWashoe Valley this afternoon. For the Sierra ridges, gusts up to\n90 mph are expected.\n\nThese winds may produce travel restrictions for high profile\nvehicles, along with rough lake conditions and areas of turbulence\nfor aviation.\n\nIn addition, light snowfall could produce travel impacts for\nhigher elevation roads and passes in northeast California this\nmorning, then spreading south to the main Sierra passes west of\nLake Tahoe this afternoon and evening. Snowfall totals of 2 to 5\ninches are possible for Donner Summit, Echo Pass, Fredonyer\nSummit, CA-44 west of Susanville, and Cedar Pass. Lighter snowfall\ngenerally an inch or less is possible for the Lake Tahoe basin,\nMt. Rose Summit, the Surprise Valley, and near the Sierra crest in\nAlpine and Mono counties.\n\nAcross western Nevada, most areas will be shadowed out of rain and\nsnow, except far northern Washoe County near the Oregon border\nwhere a period of rain or a rain and snow mix is possible.",
