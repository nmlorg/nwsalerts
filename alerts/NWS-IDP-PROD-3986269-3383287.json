        "description": "The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has extended\nthe\n\n* Flood Advisory for...\nNorthern Anderson County in Upstate South Carolina...\nCentral Pickens County in Upstate South Carolina...\nSoutheastern Oconee County in Upstate South Carolina...\n\n* Until 1145 PM EST Friday.\n\n* At 518 PM EST, Doppler radar indicates the earlier heavy rainfall\nhas ended across Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens counties; however, an\narea of 1-3 inches of rainfall occurred between approximately 9:30am\nand noon, causing flooding of low-lying areas and roadways. Excessive\nrunoff from this rainfall is still working through area streams.\nWhile most small streams have crested and receded, larger streams\nincluding Eighteenmile Creek are still out of banks and are just now\ncresting.  Therefore, it will take several more hours for larger\nstreams to crest and fully recede below critical levels.  Therefore,\nthe Flood Advisory will be extended until these larger streams fall\nbelow Action/Advisory Stage.\n\n* Several reports of flooded roads were received by local media\nand law enforcement earlier this afternoon, especially in the urban\ncenters of Central, Clemson, Easley, and Pendleton.  These roads\nincluded: Grant Street in Easley, Central Road in Pendleton,\nIsaqueena Trail and Berkeley Road in Clemson, and Pinedale Road in\nCentral.  While most floodwaters have receded along smaller streams,\nresidual flooding of poorly draining areas and areas adjacent to\nlarger streams may continue for a few more hours. It is important\nto continue to heed all barricades and seek an alternative route,\nespecially at night.\n\n* The following streamgauge exceeded Action/Advisory Stage:\nEighteenmile Creek at SC 28 in Pendleton.\n\nCurrent Stage: 11.43 feet and cresting.\nForecast: Eighteenmile Creek will fall below Action/Advisory Stage\nbefore midnight tonight.\nAction Stage: 10.5 feet.\nMinor Flood Stage: 12.0 feet.\nImpacts: At 11.0 feet the creek will be flooding low-lying areas\nadjacent to SC 28 and flooding of Bishop Branch Rd. and Central Rd.\nis likely.\n\n* Some locations that may continue to experience residual flooding\ninclude...Easley, Clemson, Seneca, Powdersville, Piedmont, Central,\nPendleton, Liberty, Norris and Townville.",
        "instruction": "Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nBe especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the\ndangers of flooding.",
