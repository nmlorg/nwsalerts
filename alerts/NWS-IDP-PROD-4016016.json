        "description": "Areawide observations and web cameras have shown significant\nimprovement in visibility within light fog or haze this morning.\nDrier air that has moved in behind a slow south moving coastal\nfrontal boundary has been the impetus to inhibiting or the\nevaporation of recent dense fog.\n\nPockets of fog will still exist throughout the day that will\nperiodically lower visibilities from 4 to 6 miles down to around 2\nto 3 miles. A heightened sense of caution is still required as\nthere are low probabilities that fog could become locally dense\nand briefly lower visibilites down to under 2 miles.\n\nAs winds become more southeast through the day, the return of more\nareawide fog is anticipated tonight. Sea fog will likely become\ndense once again later tonight and persist through the early\nSaturday morning hours. This will initiate the reissuance of\nMarine Dense Fog Advisories.",
