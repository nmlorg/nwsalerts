        "description": "A disturbance moving through the Deep South is producing some\nlight precipitation across portions of the area this morning.\nWhile the precipitation will fall as rain and/or snow at times,\ntemperatures will only be marginally cold enough for light snow\nto accumulate on area ridgetops, and then mainly on the\ngrassy/leafy areas. No more than a dusting, if that, is expected\nin the valleys. The most likely location for any accumulations\nwould be along ridge top locations generally south of the Hal\nRogers Parkway and KY Highway 80, where a half of an inch could\naccumulate on grassy/leafy areas and elevated surfaces.",
