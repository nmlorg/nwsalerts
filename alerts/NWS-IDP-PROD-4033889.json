In\naddition, temperatures remain right around freezing, causing some\nuntreated surfaces with residual moisture from the rain and/or\nfog to become slippery. Visibilities may vary rapidly over short\ndistances and could fall to one quarter mile or less at times. If\ndriving, slow down, use your low beam headlights, and leave plenty\nof distance in front of you.",
