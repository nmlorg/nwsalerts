Use caution\nduring the morning commute as temperatures in a few of these same\nplaces are at or just below freezing. This could cause freezing fog\non bridges and overpasses causing them to be slick.\n\nMotorists are urged to drive with extreme caution, as visibilities\nwill vary significantly given the patchy nature of the fog. Use low\nbeams, reduce driving speed, and allow for plenty of room between\nyou and other cars.\n\nStay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio, or a favorite local media outlet,\nfor further statements or updates from the National Weather Service\nin Huntsville.",
