        "description": "A strong cold front will move through the South Plains region late\nthis afternoon and early this evening. The front will usher in\nmuch colder air on gusty northerly winds sustained at 25 to 35\nmph, with gusts to 45 mph. In addition, scattered rain showers\nwill develop along and behind the cold front late this afternoon,\nthen spread southeastward across the South Plains and Rolling\nPlains through the evening hours. As temperatures drop, the rain\nshowers will transition to snow showers this evening, persisting\noff the Caprock into early Saturday morning. Light accumulations\nof snow, from a dusting to an inch, will be possible in spots\nacross the southern Texas Panhandle, South Plains and Rolling\nPlains. Although the precipitation will be scattered and light,\nit could create slick spots on area roadways as temperatures fall\ninto the upper teens and 20s by early Saturday morning. The\ncolder temperatures combined with the gusty winds will also lead\nto wind chill values in the single digits to lower teens late\ntonight into Saturday morning.",
