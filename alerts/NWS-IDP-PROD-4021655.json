        "description": "There will be potential travel impacts across northern Sierra\npasses on Tuesday with a few inches of snowfall expected as a\nweaker end winter storm arrives.\n\nSnow levels on Tuesday will generally remain between 5500-6000\nfeet with snowfall accumulations of 2-5 inches possible on\nnorthern Sierra passes (Donner Summit, Echo Summit, Carson Pass)\nwith about 1-2 inches possible for Fredonyer, Brockway, Mt Rose,\nand ridges across Mono County. Accumulations near Lake Tahoe level\nand Mammoth Lakes look generally less than an inch.\n\nInitial snow onset Tuesday across western Lassen county will be\naround 4-6am, then across the Tahoe Basin about 8-10am with the\nbest potential mid-Tuesday afternoon into the early evening.\n\nAcross western Nevada, this system will largely be shadowed out\nwith the exception of far northern Washoe County near the Oregon\nborder where up to a tenth of an inch of rainfall is possible.\n\nThis will be more of a wind maker for the lower valleys with wind\ngusts of 35-45 mph across the Tahoe Basin and along the US-395\nand I-580 corridor from Walker northward. Winds may result in\nhazardous boating conditions across area lakes and possible travel\nrestrictions for high profile vehicles where cross winds are\npresent.",
