Locations impacted include Dickinson, Beach, Killdeer,\nWatford City, Williston, and north to the Canadian border.\n\nThe fog will make travel hazardous this morning, due to low\nvisibility and some riming on roads that could make them\nslippery. Use caution, slow down, and use low beam headlights.\n\nThe fog will lift later this morning.",
