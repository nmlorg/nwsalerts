Heavy freezing spray at a rate\nof 2 cm per hour or greater expected, and may rapidly\naccumulate on vessels.\n\n* WHERE...Upper Entrance of Portage Canal to Eagle River MI and\nEagle River to Manitou Island MI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, until 9 AM EST Wednesday. For the\nHeavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 4 PM this afternoon to 10\nAM EST Wednesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",

If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
