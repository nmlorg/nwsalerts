Some additional light snow accumulations of\nless than one inch are possible. A flash freeze of wet\nroadways and other surfaces is likely overnight, as much\ncolder air surges southward. Strong and gusty north winds\naround 40 mph will also accompany the cold air.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of central, south central, and southeast\nKansas.\n\n* WHEN...Through the late evening hours.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions especially for\nuntreated surfaces tonight as colder air spreads southward.\nThis could cause a refreeze of wet and slushy roads tonight,\npossibly impacting the Thursday morning commute. In addition,\nthe very cold air will combine with strong north winds to\ncreate sub zero wind chills for late tonight and early\nThursday morning.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures will fall below freezing by\nmidnight and into teens by Thursday morning.",
