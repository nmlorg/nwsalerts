For the Freezing\nSpray Advisory, light accumulation of freezing spray expected.\n\n* WHERE...Intra Coastal Waters from Schoodic Point, ME to\nStonington, ME, Coastal Waters from Eastport, ME to Schoodic\nPoint, ME out 25 NM and Coastal Waters from Schoodic Point, ME\nto Stonington, ME out 25 NM.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, from 4 PM this afternoon to 4 PM\nEST Friday. For the Freezing Spray Advisory, from 3 AM Friday\nto 9 AM EST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in freezing spray is hazardous.\nFreezing spray may render mechanical and electronic components\ninoperative. Ice accretion on decks and superstructures may\nresult in some loss of stability. Strong winds will cause\nhazardous seas which could capsize or damage vessels and\nreduce visibility.",
