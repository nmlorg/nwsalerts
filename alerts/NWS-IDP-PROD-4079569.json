        "description": "It's going to be a wet start to the new week, and new month. While\nmost of the weekend looks dry, rain chances really ramp up during\nSunday afternoon and evening.\n\nKeeping in mind we are still 3 to 5 days away from this rain\nevent, several models are showing a prolonged moderate to heavy\nrain event from Sunday afternoon through Wednesday time frame.\nThe envelope of potential forecast storm total amounts range from\nas low as 2 inches, to perhaps as high as 5 or 7 inches, by the\ntime it all winds down later in the week. The biggest problem\nis that the Mid-South still has not fully recovered from our\nrecent rainfall events. The ground remains saturated, and rivers,\nwhile falling, are running fairly high. If this heavy rain does\noccur, expect a myriad of flooding issues again, from roadway\nponding, to more widespread street and areal flooding. Subsiding\ncreeks and streams will be filling up again, and all of this water\nwill dump into the river systems, ultimately halting their falls\nand climbing them back up again.\n\nUse your time now to prepare accordingly, and stay tuned to the\nlatest updated forecasts for this next incoming heavy rain system.",
