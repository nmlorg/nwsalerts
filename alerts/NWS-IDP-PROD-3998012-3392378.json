The\nhighest rain rates were 1 to 2 inches per hour from Kipahulu to\nKeanae. Stream levels in the area continue to run above normal.\nAdditional rain bands are expected to move over windward Haleakala\nthrough today.\n\n* Locations in the advisory include but are not limited to...\nHaiku-Pauwela, Huelo, Pauwela, Kipahulu, Makawao, Nahiku, Hana,\nKailua and Haleakala National Park.",
