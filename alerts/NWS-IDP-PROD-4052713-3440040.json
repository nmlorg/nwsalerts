        "description": "The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has extended\nthe\n\n* Flood Advisory for...\nWest central Mecklenburg County in the Piedmont of North\nCarolina...\nSoutheastern Gaston County in the Piedmont of North Carolina...\n\n* Until 915 AM EST Tuesday.\n\n* At 915 PM EST, Widespread rainfall accumulations of 3-5 inches\nbetween February 5 and February 7 over the entire Catawba River\nwatershed has caused high flows and elevated lake levels along the\nCatawba River reservoir chain. As the excess water is passed\nthrough each lake project downstream, significant pool rises have\noccurred at the middle Catawba River lakes, especially at\nMountain Island Lake, where the pool is above the full pool of\n100.0 feet. This is causing nuisance shoreline flooding and\nflooding of lake-access areas, campgrounds, docks, and residential\nyards.\n\n* As water spills over Mountain Island Dam, high flows are causing\nrises just downstream of the dam along the Catawba River. Based on\ncurrent pool elevations, nuisance flooding of low-lying areas\nadjacent to the river can be expected to persist through tonight\nor while the pool at Mountain Island Lake remains at or above\n101.5 feet.\n\n* Additional rainfall is expected tonight through Tuesday across the\nCatawba River watershed.  Rainfall totals of 1-3\" are forecasted\nthrough Tuesday afternoon, and this rainfall will result in\nadditional flow that will need to be passed through the Catawba\nreservoir system.  With the pool at Lake Norman near 99 feet, this\nadditional water may require additional releases at Cowans Ford Dam,\nwhich will result in additional rises and more significant flooding\nat Mountain Island Lake and the Catawba River immediately downstream\nof the dam.\n\n* The following reservoir is experiencing Action/Advisory Stage\npool elevations:\n\nMountain Island Lake.\nCURRENT Pool Elevation: 101.59 feet and nearly steady.\n\nFORECAST: Duke Energy projects the pool will exceed 102 feet\nTuesday morning and potentially exceed 103.5 feet later Tuesday if\nthe forecasted rainfall occurs.\n\nACTION/ADVISORY Stage: 101.5 feet.\nMINOR Flood Stage: 103.0 feet.\n\nIMPACTS: At 101.5 feet, Action/Advisory Stage. Nuisance flooding of\nlow-lying areas including residential yards, docks, and boat-launch\nareas is ongoing.  Flooding of residential yards downstream of\nMountain Island Dam along Riverhaven Dr, Hart Rd, Lake Dr, and\nRiverside Dr is beginning.\n\nAt 103.0 feet, Minor Flood Stage. Significant inundation of\nlow-lying areas is ongoing around Mountain Island Lake and downstream\nof the dam along/near Riverside Dr. Some outbuilding inundation may\nbegin.\n\n* Residents should take immediate actions to protect property\nadjacent to Mountain Island Lake and the Catawba River, closely\nmonitor lake levels for sudden changes, and follow guidance from\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Emergency Management. Drivers are encouraged\nto heed any barricades and avoid all flooded areas.\n\n* For more information on lake levels or dam releases, people are\nencouraged to visit http://lakes.duke-energy.com or call 1-800-829-\n5253.",
