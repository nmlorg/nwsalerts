        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nDriftwood River...East Fork White River...Wabash River...White\nRiver...Wildcat Creek...\n\n.As of Tuesday morning, minor to moderate flooding continues on the\nWabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers in central and southern\nIndiana.  Flooding has ended along most of the creeks and smaller\nrivers.  Flooding is the result of up to about 4 inches of rain that\nfell late last week.\n\nThe large majority of the Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers\nare either in flood or expected to flood, with some locations\nreaching moderate flood stage.  Crests are expected to be the\nhighest since either February or June of 2019.\n\nThe Wabash River crested earlier yesterday at Lafayette, Montezuma,\nand Clinton and continues to rise along points downstream.  The\ncrest on the White River was near Elliston.  The crest along the\nEast Fork White River was between Seymour and Rivervale. Flooding\nalong the lower portions of the White and Wabash River is likely to\ncontinue through the end of the month.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday which\nwill allow smaller rivers to continue to recede this week.\nAbove normal precipitation is possible this coming Friday\ninto Saturday, which could exacerbate elevated water levels and\nlead to renewed flooding on area waterways.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Terre Haute.\n* until Tuesday January 21.\n* At  8:30 AM Tuesday the stage was 22.1 feet. This is 2.0 to 2.5\nfeet higher than the observations from the old legacy gauge.\n* Flood stage is 16.5 feet. This is 2.5 feet higher than flood stage\nfrom the old legacy gauge.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will rise to near 22.6 feet by Wednesday morning then\nbegin falling. It will fall below flood stage Tuesday January 21.\n* At 22.5 feet...Extensive flooding behind Honey Creek Levee as a\nresult of two unrepaired levee breaks from the April 2013 flood.\nThis levee is maintained by the Honey Creek Levee Association.\nFlood waters behind the Honey Creek levee inundates most roads and\naffects a few residences and or commercial activities.",
        "instruction": "Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...\n\nMotorists should never drive into flood water. Turn around and go\nanother way. Keep children away from flooded areas. Recreational and\nagricultural interests should remain alert to changing river\nconditions.\n\nFor detailed flood information go to weather.gov/ind on the web and\nclick on rivers and lakes.",
