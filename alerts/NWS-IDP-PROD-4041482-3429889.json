Up to two inches of rain have already\nfallen, with another inch likely over the next 12 hours. Tributary\nrises continue in the area, with reports of two minor mudslides in\nSaltville and several roads closed in Tazewell County. The Clinch\nRiver at Richlands continues to rise, currently situated at 8.56\nft with a flood stage of 10 feet. With the expected additional\nrainfall, the river will likely rise above flood stage later this\nmorning, possibly cresting near 13 feet. If this were to occur,\nthis would be the highest readings since November of 2003.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nMarion...\nRichlands...\nBluefield...\nTazewell...\nand Saltville.",
        "instruction": "Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nExcessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of small\ncreeks and streams, country roads, farmland, and other low lying\nspots.\n\nWhen it is safe to do so, please send your reports of flooding,\nincluding mudslides or flooded roads, to the National Weather Service\nby calling toll free at 1...8 6 6...2 1 5...4 3 2 4.
