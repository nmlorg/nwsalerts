In its wake look for\ntemperatures to fall quickly for western Alaska both coastal and\ninterior locations as Siberian high pressure builds in.\n\nLook for temperatures to range from -20 to -30 along the coast\nwith -30 to -40 possible for the western interior by Tuesday\nmorning lasting through the remainder of the week with a slight\nwarming trend for the upcoming weekend.\n\nConfidence remains fairly low on the length of the cold spell for\nthe region as computer models differ on opinions for the region.\n\nResidents should prepare for cold temperatures, especially if\ntraveling, by keeping cold weather gear available at all times.\n\nFor the latest forecast go to www.weather.gov/afg",
