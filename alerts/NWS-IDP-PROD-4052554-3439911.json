These swells will\ncontinue to hold through most of night, then gradually decrease\nbeginning Tuesday. This could cause significant beach erosion,\noverwash onto vulnerable low-lying coastal roadways, and surges\nwithin north and west facing harbors such as Haleiwa and Waianae\nthrough tonight.\n\n* WHAT...Surf will be 20 to 30 feet tonight, lowering to 20 to 25\nfeet early Tuesday along north and west facing shores of Niihau\nand Kauai, as well as north facing shores of Oahu, Molokai, and\nMaui. Surf will be 14 to 22 feet tonight, lowering to 12 to 20\nfeet early Tuesday along west facing shores of Oahu and\nMolokai.\n\n* WHERE...North and west facing shores of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu,\nMolokai, and north facing shores of Maui.\n\n* WHEN...Through 6 AM HST Tuesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...High. Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping\nacross portions of beaches, very strong breaking waves, and\nstrong longshore and rip currents. Breaking waves may\noccasionally impact harbors making navigating the harbor\nchannel dangerous.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of onshore winds, large\nsurf, and peak monthly tides will could cause beach erosion,\nflooding of beaches that normally remain dry and overwash onto\nvulnerable low-lying coastal roads and other coastal\ninfrastructure.",
