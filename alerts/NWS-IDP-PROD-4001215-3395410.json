Strong rip currents and sneaker waves.\n\n* WHERE...West to northwest facing beaches of the San Luis\nObispo County and Santa Barbara County Central Coast.\n\n* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 6 AM PST Monday.\n\n* IMPACTS...There is an increased risk for ocean drowning. Rip\ncurrents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea. Large\nbreaking waves can cause injury, wash people off beaches and\nrocks, and capsize small boats near shore.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...An above normal high tide of 6.5 feet\nlate Sunday morning will result in the possibility of\nlocalized minor coastal flooding at that time over low-lying\ncoastal areas such as beach parking lots and harbor walkways.\nNo significant damage is expected.",
