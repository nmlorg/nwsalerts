        "description": "Cold air will move south through British Columbia this weekend. On\nSunday, a weather system will arrive as cold Fraser outflow develops.\nRain will change to snow in the Bellingham area and in the San\nJuans on Sunday. Cold wind chills will develop and blowing snow\nwill be possible around Bellingham and in the San Juans.\n\nCold air will spread south through the rest of Western Washington\nSunday night along the modified arctic front. Temperatures that fall\nbelow freezing can lead to icy roads after even light snowfall.\n\nAreas along the coast and across Southwest Washington will not\navoid the cold snap. A weather system moving into Oregon on\nMonday could affect southwest Washington. At this time it looks\nlike most of the moisture with that weather system will remain in\nOregon but stay tuned to updated weather forecasts and prepare\nfor wintry weather.",
