        "description": "...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS EXPECTED IN WESTERN MINNESOTA WEDNESDAY...\n...DANGEROUS WIND CHILLS EXPECTED WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH\nTHURSDAY MORNING...\n\n.A Blizzard Warning remains in effect for portions of west\ncentral and southwest Minnesota starting 6 am Wednesday morning,\nand continues through the afternoon. A Winter Storm Watch with\npossible blizzard conditions surrounds the blizzard warning in\nwest central, southwest and south central Minnesota for the same\ntime period. Wind Chill Warnings remain in effect for west\ncentral through southwestern Minnesota, with Wind Chill Advisories\nin place for east central Minnesota, portions of southeast\nMinnesota and far western Wisconsin for Wednesday night into\nThursday morning.\n\nConfidence has increased that portions of west central and\nsouthwest Minnesota, mainly west of a Morris to Redwood Falls to\nSt. James line, will have blizzard conditions developing behind a\nstrong Arctic front on Wednesday. The combination of strong gusty\nwinds and whiteout conditions will lead to blizzard conditions\nfor several hours. Confidence is lower on wind speeds farther to\nthe east and thus a Winter Storm Watch has been issued.\n\nOutside the warning and watch area, significant blowing and\ndrifting snow is likely, with locally one to two inches of snow\nby the afternoon.\n\nIn addition to the blizzard conditions, temperatures will drop\noff sharply behind the Arctic front. Wind chill values will drop\n30 degrees below zero by the afternoon in west central Minnesota,\nwith wind chills likely dropping to 35 degrees below zero by the\nevening, persisting through Thursday morning. In eastern\nMinnesota into western Wisconsin, wind chills will drop to\nbetween 25 and 35 degrees below zero late Wednesday night through\nThursday morning. Outside the warning and watch area, significant\nblowing and drifting snow is likely, with locally one to two\ninches of snow by the afternoon.\n\n* WHAT...Very cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as low as\n35 below zero.\n\n* WHERE...Kanabec, Isanti, Sherburne, Le Sueur and Carver\nCounties.\n\n* WHEN...From midnight Wednesday night to 10 AM CST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...The dangerously cold wind chills could cause\nfrostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10 minutes.",
