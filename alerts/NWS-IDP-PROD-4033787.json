        "description": "A strong Pacific storm system is forecast to move into the\nnorthern Rockies Sunday, bringing a variety of winter weather\nhazards for Sunday and Monday. First, snow is expected to begin\nacross the Central Mountains Sunday morning, spreading southeast\ninto the Arco Desert, eastern Magic Valley, and Raft River area\nby Sunday afternoon. The snow may briefly mix with rain in the\neastern Magic Valley and Raft River area initially, before\ntemperatures cool. Snow will continue into Monday morning,\naccumulating 2 to 5 inches across the Central Mountains with\nlocally up to 8 inches above pass level, 1 to 2 inches in the Wood\nRiver Valley and Lincoln County, and 2 to 5 inches across the\neastern Magic Valley and Raft River area. Second, a strong cold\nfront will blast across the region Sunday afternoon and evening.\nIf roads are wet, rapidly falling temperatures behind the front\nmay result in a flash freeze, resulting in icy roads, especially\nif they are untreated. Finally, southwest winds of 10 to 15 MPH\ngusting to 35 MPH are expected Sunday afternoon across the eastern\nMagic Valley to Arco Desert, shifting into the northwest at 15 to\n20 MPH gusting to 35 MPH Monday. Winds across the Central\nMountains will largely be out of the north to northwest at similar\nspeeds at higher elevations, a bit lower in the valleys. Winds of\nthis magnitude may result in areas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nThe combination of a possible flash freeze, moderate snow, and\nblowing and drifting snow may result in hazardous travel\nconditions across the region, especially from Sunday evening\nthrough Monday evening. Snow covered and icy roads and reduced\nvisibilities are possible.\n\nStay tuned to the latest updates and possible watches, warnings,\nand advisories from the National Weather Service.",
