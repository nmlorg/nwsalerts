The southern coastal waters will likely continue\nto experience visibilities from one quarter mile to near zero at\ntimes through mid-morning.\n\nMariners in harbor, especially those without radar, should\nconsider remaining in harbor until the dense fog improves.\nPoor visibilities can obscure vision of exposed rocks and other\nvessels, including large ships in the shipping lanes.",
