        "description": "...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS POSSIBLE SATURDAY AFTERNOON...\n\n.Abnormally warm temperatures Saturday with daytime highs climbing\ninto the upper 60s are expected across portions of southwest and\nwestern Nebraska. As these temperatures rise, humidity values will\nfall near to slightly below critical levels by the middle of the\nafternoon. Strong westerly winds will develop with gusts of up to\n25 mph expected for much of western Nebraska and gusts possibly\nexceeding 30 mph across the eastern Panhandle and far western\nSandhills. This combination of warm temperatures, dry conditions,\nand gusty winds along with cured fuels will potentially produce\ncritical fire weather conditions. Any fire starts will have\nthe potential for rapid fire growth in the watch area.\n\nThe National Weather Service in North Platte has issued a Fire\nWeather Watch FOR wind and low relative humidity, which is in\neffect from Saturday morning through Saturday afternoon.\n\n* Affected Area...In NEZ204...Fire Weather Zone 204 Eastern\nPanhandle/Crescent Lake NWR. In NEZ210...Fire Weather Zone 210\nFrenchman Basin.\n\n* Winds...West 15 to 20 mph with gusts up to 35 mph.\n\n* Relative Humidity...Around 20 percent.\n\n* Temperatures...In the upper 50s.\n\n* Impacts...Any fires that develop have a high potential to spread\nrapidly.",
