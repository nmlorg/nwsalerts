        "description": "...Wintry Mess Wednesday...\n\n.A winter storm will spread across eastern Kansas and Missouri\nWednesday morning, lingering through late Wednesday night. This\nstorm will start with snow Wednesday morning, but surface\ntemperatures will likely warm up just enough to convert the\nprecipitation type to rain by the late morning to early afternoon\nhours, with a mix of rain and snow through the afternoon. However,\ntemperatures will crash back down Wednesday evening as a strong\ncold front catches up to the broad area of precipitation still\noccurring across the region. This will result in sufficent\nsnowfall Wednesday night to warrent keeping the advisory going\nthrough midnight as the whole system moves east.\n\n* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of up to two\ninches. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of north central, northeast and northwest\nMissouri.\n\n* WHEN...From noon Wednesday to midnight CST Wednesday night.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. The hazardous\nconditions could impact the evening commute.",
