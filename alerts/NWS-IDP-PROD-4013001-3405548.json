For the Small Craft Advisory, northwest\nwinds 15 to 20 knots with gusts up to 25 knots and waves 2 to\n5 feet.\n\n* WHERE...Port Wing to Sand Island WI and Sand Island to\nBayfield WI.\n\n* WHEN...Until 9 AM CST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
