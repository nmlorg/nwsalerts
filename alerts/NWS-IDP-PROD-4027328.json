Though temperatures over much of Jefferson county,\nincluding at Watertown and Fort Drum, are in the 40s, a shallow\nlayer of cold air near the St. Lawrence River is keeping readings\nthere around freezing. As the steady rain moves in this morning,\nsome freezing rain is possible near the Saint Lawrence River.\nUntreated roads and elevated surfaces could see minor ice\naccumulations of less than one-tenth of an inch. If traveling this\nmorning near the Saint Lawrence River, plan on the potential for\nicy conditions.",
