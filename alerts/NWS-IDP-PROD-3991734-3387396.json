For the Small Craft Advisory,\nnorthwest winds 15 to 25 knots with gusts up to 35 knots and\nwaves 2 to 4 feet.\n\n* WHERE...Oak Point to Saxon Harbor WI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, until 6 AM CST\nWednesday. For the Small Craft Advisory, until 4 AM CST\nWednesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
