Additionally,\nbreaking wave heights of 17 to 22 feet will be possible at favored\nlocations along the shore on Thursday. The swell will begin to\ndecrease on Thursday night, but breaking waves heights up to 15\nto 20 feet will remain possible through Friday morning.\n\n* WHAT...Increased risk of sneaker waves, rip currents, and\nlarge shore break are expected.\n\n* WHERE...San Francisco, Coastal North Bay Including Point Reyes\nNational Seashore, San Francisco Peninsula Coast, Northern\nMonterey Bay and Southern Monterey Bay and Big Sur Coast\nCounties.\n\n* WHEN...From Thursday morning through Friday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Rip currents can pull swimmers and surfers out to sea.\nSneaker waves can knock unsuspecting beach goers over and into\nthe sea.",
