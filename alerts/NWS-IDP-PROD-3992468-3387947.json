Rain coming in overnight\ncould keep some river levels from falling or even cause additional\nrises, but should not add any new flooding. Here is the latest river\nforecast updates.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Snoqualmie River Near Snoqualmie Falls\n* Until late tonight.\n* At  4:00 PM Tuesday the flow was 19609 cfs.\n* Flood flow is 20000 cfs.\n* Fell below flood flow late this afternoon.\n* No additional flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...The river fell below flood stage at  3:25 PM Tuesday and\nwill continue to fall. Flooding will continue in some areas until\nthe flood wave has completely passed downstream.\n* Impact...At 12000 cfs, the Snoqualmie River will spill over its\nbanks between the town of Snoqualmie and Fall City...covering\npasture lands and several roads along the river. This river level\non the Snoqualmie corresponds roughly to a phase 2 flood in the\nKing County flood system.",
