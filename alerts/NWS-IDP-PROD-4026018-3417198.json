For\nthe High Rip Current Risk, from 7 AM this morning through 7 PM\nthis evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and\nlocalized beach erosion.

        "instruction": "High surf will affect the beaches in the advisory area, producing\nlocalized beach erosion and dangerous swimming conditions.\nSwimmers should remain out of the water due to large breaking\nwaves and dangerous surf conditions.\n\nRip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away\nfrom shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the\nsandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and\npiers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.",
