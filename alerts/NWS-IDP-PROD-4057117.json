        "description": "Light snow or flurries will continue at times into early Thursday\nmorning. Any additional accumulation should be less than an inch\nThe combination of new snow, or melting snow on pavement surfaces\nfrom yesterday afternoon will continue to cause untreated roads,\nbridges, parking lots and sidewalks to be snow or ice covered.\nGusty northerly winds may also create some areas of blowing and\ndrifting snow.\n\nTemperatures around daybreak on Thursday are expected to fall\nto 5 below to 5 above zero. The combination of the cold temperatures\nand gusty northerly winds will produce wind chill readings in the\n10 below to 20 below zero range late tonight into Thursday\nmorning. Wind chill readings this low can produce frost bite\nin 30 minutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving tonight, as roads\nwill be slippery due to ice or snow. If venturing outdoors, wear\nlayers of clothing along with a hat and gloves to protect yourself\nfrom the cold.",
