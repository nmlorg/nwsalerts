Fog should clear out within a few\nhours of sunrise.\n\nReduction in visibility and some slippery spots on area roads,\nbridges, and sidewalks are possible. Motorists are urged to drive\nwith caution, as visibilities will vary significantly given the\npatchy nature of the fog. Use low beams, reduce driving speed, and\nallow for plenty of room between you and other cars.",
