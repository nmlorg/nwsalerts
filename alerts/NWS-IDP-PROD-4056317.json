        "description": "An arctic cold front across northern Wisconsin will drop southward\nacross the Fox Valley and lakeshore region early this evening. The\narctic front will be noted by a wind shift to the north or\nnorthwest with sustained winds of 20 to 30 mph with gusts to 35\nmph, and a sudden drop in air temperatures.\n\nLight snow will overspread the Fox Valley and lakeshore region\nearly this evening with the arctic front and a system passing to\nthe south of the area. The snow should taper off late tonight.\nSnowfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected by daybreak on\nThursday.\n\nThe combination of the falling snow, along with melting snow on\npavement surfaces and falling air temperatures well below freezing\ncould lead to a flash freeze by mid evening. Gusty northerly\nwinds may also create some areas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nOvernight, temperatures are expected to fall into the single\ndigits to around 10 above zero. The combination of the cold\ntemperatures and gusty northerly winds will produce wind chill\nreadings down to around 10 below zero late tonight into Thursday\nmorning. Wind chill readings this low can produce frost bite in 30\nminutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving this evening as\nroads will become slippery due to ice or snow. If venturing\noutdoors overnight, wear layers of clothing along with a hat and\ngloves to protect yourself from the cold.",
