Periods of greatly\nreduced visibility can also be expected along the higher ridge\ntops either side of the Mississippi River through the afternoon,\nthough widespread blizzard conditions are not likely.\n\nIf traveling through the afternoon and early evening, especially\nover the ridge tops or across southern Minnesota and northern\nIowa, be prepared that driving will be difficult to even dangerous\nat times with very low visibility. Additionally, be aware that\nrapidly falling temperatures will allow any earlier wet roads to\nrefreeze quickly.\n\n* WHAT...Northwest winds gusting to 40 mph this afternoon,\nresulting in some blowing and drifting snow. Rapidly falling\ntemperatures this afternoon.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of central, southwest and west central\nWisconsin, northeast Iowa and southeast Minnesota.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing\nsnow will significantly reduce visibility at times for open and\nunsheltered areas. Cold wind chills as low as 20 below zero\ntonight could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30\nminutes.",
