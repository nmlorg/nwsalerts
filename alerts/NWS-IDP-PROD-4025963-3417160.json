        "description": "...Period of Light Freezing Rain This Morning...\n\n.Low pressure tracking across the Ohio Valley into the Great\nLakes will spread rain across the Mid Atlantic region beginning\nthis morning, continuing through this evening. The precipitation\nmay begin as freezing rain, and perhaps even briefly mixed with\nsleet near the Interstate 64 corridor, before changing to all\nrain during the mid to late morning. The threat for freezing rain\nwill linger the longest near the Interstate 64 corridor and the\nsouthern Shenandoah Valley. Most ice accumulations are only\nexpected to amount to a trace, with perhaps a few hundredths of an\ninch of ice along the Blue Ridge Parkway. The most critical time\nframe for any icing will be early this morning when temperatures\nare near 32F. After it becomes daylight, temperatures will slowly\ncreep upward with icing becoming less of a threat.\n\n* WHAT...Freezing rain, briefly mixed with sleet this morning,\nchanging to rain by midday. Only trace amounts of sleet and ice\nexpected. Ice accumulations of 0.01 to 0.05 inch. Winds gusting\nas high as 35 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of southwest Virginia and northwest North\nCarolina, mainly along the Blue Ridge.\n\n* WHEN...Mainly this morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Some bridges, overpasses, and mainly secondary\nuntreated roads could become slippery and hazardous early this\nmorning. The hazardous conditions could impact the morning\ncommute.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Untreated roads and sidewalks may become\nslick. Use caution and plan on extra time to reach your\ndestination in the morning.",
