        "description": "...HEAVY SNOW EXPECTED ACROSS CENTRAL AND EAST-CENTRAL WISCONSIN\nTODAY...\n\n.A low pressure system located over extreme northwest Iowa at\ndaybreak will track to northeast Iowa by noon, then along the\nWisconsin/Illinois border this afternoon. This is a rather compact\nbut vigorous storm system, and will bring a significant snowfall\nto all but far northern Wisconsin. The storm is also fast moving,\nso snow will quickly overspread the area during the morning, but\nalso diminish quickly from west to east during the late afternoon\nand evening.\n\nAlthough winds are not expected to be strong during the storm,\nthe heavy snowfall could reduce the visibility to under 1/4 mile\nat times, especially in central and east-central Wisconsin. This\nwill likely result in hazardous travel conditions. Air travel is\nalso likely to be affected by the storm.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 5 to\n10 inches, with the lower totals occurring north of Green Bay.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of east-central and northeast Wisconsin.\n\n* WHEN...Until 9 PM CST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel will become difficult due to snow covered\nroads and greatly reduced visibility in the heavy snow.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow will spread east across the area this\nmorning, reaching the northern portion of Door county by\nlunchtime. The snow will quickly become heavy. The fast onset\nof heavy snow is likely to result in very rapidly deteriorating\ntravel conditions during the middle to late morning.",
        "instruction": "If traveling during the storm, expect to drive at a much slower\nthan normal speed and allow plenty of time to reach your\ndestination. Be sure to take some food and water along with you\nin your vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road\nconditions can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.",
