This setup is\nexpected to bring copious rainfall to the state Thursday afternoon\nthrough Saturday morning, with the heaviest rainfall coming late\nFriday through Friday night.  As of late Wednesday morning, rainfall\ntotals by Saturday evening are predicted to total 2.50 to 3.50\ninches in much of central and southern Indiana.  Today's river\nforecasts capture a portion of the expected rainfall associated with\nthe incoming system.  A much better idea of how high the rivers will\nlikely go will come with Thursday's forecast model run.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River at Hazleton.\n* until further notice.\n* There have been no observations in the last 24 hours.\n* Flood stage is 16.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It is forecast to crest at 19.8 feet Friday January 17\nand will rise above flood stage by late Sunday night.\n* At 20.0 feet...Most of the low bottomlands flood. Flooding begins in\nhigher bottomlands. High water affects any residents in Pottsville\nriver cabins. Pottsville Road...North C Street on river side of\nrailroad tracks and Catt Street near U. S. Highway 41 are flooded.\nWater is near or starting on Giro Road in the vicinity of submerged\nPottsville Road. Oil stripped fields flood. Flood gates must be\ninstalled at Hazleton.",
