Elevated winds, especially within\nrain bands, is expected to produce gale force winds in the\nregion. Sustained winds up to 40 knots, with higher gusts, is\nforecast through Monday.\n\nStrong winds coupled with large storm surges can generate hazardous\nwaves which could capsize or damage vessels. Widespread showers,\nheavy at times can also reduce visibility, especially near\nthunderstorms.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible hazardous\nconditions by remaining in port, seeking safe harbor, altering\ncourse, and/or securing the vessel for severe wind and seas.\n\nListen to NOAA Weather Radio for the latest updates.
