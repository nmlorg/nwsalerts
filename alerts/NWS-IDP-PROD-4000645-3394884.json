Although heavy rain will be possible over\nleeward locations, the areas most susceptible to flooding will\nbe windward and mountain locations, where grounds are already\nsaturated from previous rainfall.\n\n* The extended period of rain could cause flooding in low spots\nwhich could make some roadways impassable. Debris in streams\nand gulches may clog bridges and culverts. Strong winds may\ncause tree branches to fall which will potentially add to the\namount of debris.",

Do not cross fast\nflowing water in your vehicle or on foot.\n\nMonitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action if a Flash\nFlood Warning is issued. If you experience heavy rain or rising\nwater, head to higher ground immediately.",
