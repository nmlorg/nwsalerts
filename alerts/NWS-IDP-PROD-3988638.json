        "description": "The latest forecast models continue to indicate an increasing\nthreat of heavy rainfall and possible flooding issues later this\nweek and into next weekend. A cold front will approach the region\nby late week and then is forecast to stall out across the area.\nAs this occurs, there is the possibility that multiple waves of\nheavy rainfall and thunderstorms may transverse the region.\n\nThe latest forecast models suggest that an axis of heavy\nprecipitation will likely develop over portions of the region.\nWithin that heavy band as much as 3 to 5 inches with locally\nhigher amounts will be possible. At this time, there is\nconsiderable uncertainty on where this heavy rainfall axis will\nset up.\n\nCurrently, soil conditions are saturated across the region due to\nrecent rainfall events. With this additional rainfall expected\nlater this week, flooding problems are likely to develop, possibly\nvery quickly in some areas. The highest risk of flooding will be\nin areas that are low-lying and have very poor drainage. In\naddition, area low water crossings will be under the threat of\nflooding.\n\nWater levels on area rivers are high and are running above normal\nwinter pool levels. The additional rainfall expected later this\nweek will likely push these rivers higher and some forecast points\nwill likely go into flood as early as this weekend and then\ncontinue next week.\n\nAs we move through the week, we will continue to monitor and\nrefine the precipitation forecasts. As we get more confident in\nwhere the heavy precipitation will occur, flood watches may be\nposted later this week for portions of the region.\n\nStay tuned to NOAA All Hazards Radio and your local media for the\nlatest on this potentially significant heavy rainfall and\nflooding event.",
