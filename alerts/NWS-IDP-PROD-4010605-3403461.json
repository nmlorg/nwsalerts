The crest along the East Fork White River is nearing\nnearing Rivervale where it should top out at about 28.9 feet\nmid-day Wednesday.  Flooding along the lower portions of the White\nand Wabash River is likely to continue until the weekend of\nJanuary 25.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday,\nwhich will allow drainage to continue out of area rivers this week.\nAbove normal precipitation is possible this coming Friday through\nSaturday, which could exacerbate elevated water levels and lead to\nrenewed flooding on area waterways.  Precipitation is expected to\nstart off as snow then transition to rain late Friday into Friday\nnight.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River at Seymour.\n* until Thursday evening.\n* At  7:45 PM Tuesday the stage was 16.9 feet.\n* Flood stage is 12.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by\nThursday morning.\n* At 17.0 feet...Flooding becomes more extensive.
