Wet\nsoil conditions along with the lack of vegetation in the winter\nwill cause rainfall to runoff quickly resulting in potential\nflooding.\n\n* Flooding of low water crossings and low lying roadways near\nstreams, creeks, and rivers will be possible, creating\npotentially dangerous travel conditions on roads susceptible\nto flooding",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
