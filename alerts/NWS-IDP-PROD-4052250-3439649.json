        "description": "...Flooding Potential Will Continue through Thursday Morning...\n\n.The Flood Watch has been extended through Thursday Morning to\naccount for a second round of heavy rainfall that will develop\nlate Tuesday afternoon. 2 to 4 inches of rainfall has already\noccurred over the watch area over the past 18 hours. Despite a\nbreak from the heavy rain on Tuesday, another round of heavy\nrainfall will begin as early as Tuesday afternoon and continue\nthrough Thursday morning. This second round will result in another\n2 to 4 inches of rainfall with isolated higher amounts over areas\nthat have already received between 3 to 5 inches. This will\nresult in flooding of low lying areas, creeks, local rivers, and\nroadways. In addition to areal flood risk over the watch area,\nthe threat of river flooding will increase significantly through\nduring the latter half of the watch period.\n\nThe Flood Watch is now in effect for\n\n* Portions of East Arkansas, North Mississippi, and West\nTennessee, including the following areas, in East Arkansas,\nPhillips. In North Mississippi, Alcorn, Benton, Calhoun,\nChickasaw, Coahoma, Itawamba, Lafayette, Lee, Marshall,\nMonroe, Panola, Pontotoc, Prentiss, Quitman, Tallahatchie,\nTate, Tippah, Tishomingo, Tunica, Union, and Yalobusha. In\nWest Tennessee, Hardin and McNairy.\n\n* Through Thursday morning\n\n* An additional 2 to 4 inches of rainfall with locally higher\namounts are possible over saturated soils.\n\n* Low-lying areas and areas adjacent to rivers may flood.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
