        "description": "Winter precipitation is forecast to arrive this afternoon; though\nlight snow will continue to fall prior to this band's arrival. A\nrain/snow winter mix of precipitation is expected for Rexburg, St.\nAnthony, Rigby and areas nearby then expect only snow later this\nafternoon and evening. From Ashton Hill and Island Park, Pine\nCreek Pass and Victor, expect almost continuous snowfall with a\npeak in snow intensity mid-afternoon. Those with travel plans\ntoday should allow for extra time to reach their destination and\nslow down when encountering slick and snow covered conditions.\n\nSnowfall amounts of 1 to 4 inches are possible between Idaho Falls\nand St. Anthony and is highly variable on the amount of warm air\nthat inhibits snow production. Snowfall amounts across Ashton Hill\nand Island Park are forecast between 2 and 5 inches with upwards\nof 5 inches forecast on Pine Creek Pass.\n\nWe are also monitoring a potentially developing convergence band\nin the overnight hours tonight, which would impact primarily St.\nAnthony to Idaho Falls, not to mention Dubois, the Arco Desert and\npossibly other areas further south of Idaho Falls. This would\nincrease snow amounts, create blowing and drifting snow and\nquickly reduce visibility in areas where the band sets up and\npasses through Monday morning.",
