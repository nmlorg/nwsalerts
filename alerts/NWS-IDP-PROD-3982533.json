        "description": "Starting New Year's Day, temperatures will begin a noticeable fall\nacross Southeast Alaska and change rain showers over to snow\nshowers region-wide from Wednesday afternoon into the evening.\nTemperatures New Year's Eve when we celebrate 2020 are forecast\nto be in the upper 30s to the middle 40s, and around 40 degrees by\nWednesday morning. But by late New Year's Day afternoon,\ntemperatures will have cooled to the low to mid 30s with a few\nlocations falling to the freezing point.\n\nAdditionally, much of Southeast Alaska looks to receive light\nsnowfall accumulations. Wednesday could result in some light\ndustings. Wednesday night we expect a trace to 2 inches of\naccumulation with up to an additional inch for Thursday.\n\nThere is a possibility for a much more significant snowfall event\nFriday into Saturday for portions of the southern Panhandle from\nPetersburg and Wrangell southward, including Ketchikan and Prince\nof Wales Island. However, consensus for the storm is still poor\nand it could miss the Panhandle altogether for the BC Coast.",
