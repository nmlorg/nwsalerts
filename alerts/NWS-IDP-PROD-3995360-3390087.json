Sleet and snow may mix in at times, mainly north\nof I-69, but just light accumulations if at all. Winds could\ngust as high as 40 mph, which may further increase later Sunday\nmorning.\n\n* WHERE...Sanilac, Shiawassee, Genesee, Lapeer, Livingston and\nOakland Counties.\n\n* WHEN...From late Friday night through Sunday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the\nice and strong winds. Travel could become nearly impossible.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures are expected to fall below\nfreezing late Friday night into Saturday morning. Uncertainty\nexists whether temperatures will reach and drop below 30\ndegrees, which would then allow ice to accumulate on roads and\nmay make for treacherous travel. Otherwise, ice accumulation\nmay be confined to elevated surfaces, such as tree tops and\npower lines. Prepare for the possibility of extended power\noutages and avoid travel if possible.",
