        "description": "...Parade of Winter Storms to Impact Much of Eastern Idaho into\nNext Week...\n\n.By late Friday night, a series of winter storms that will be\nmoving through the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Northwest will\nfinally push eastward enough to start affecting central and\neastern Idaho. The first storm will bring gusty winds Saturday,\nbut also 6 to 14 inches of snow to portions of the central Idaho\nmountains, mainly the Stanley Basin and Sawtooth Mountains, and\nthe entire Wood River Basin. And before Saturday sunrise, the\neastern highlands and Island Park region along the Montana border\nsouthward to the Bear River Range on the Utah border will also\nexperience heavy snow, with widespread 6 to 12 inches of new snow.\n\nThe Snake River plain, eastern Magic Valley, Lost River and\nPahsimeroi basins, and the south central highlands of Idaho will\nnot be able to dodge this series of storms either. 3 to 7 inches,\ndepending on location, are expected for Saturday and Saturday\nnight, then 1 to 4 inches on Sunday and more on Monday.\n\nThis is just the first in a parade of winter storms. More snow\narrives on Sunday and Sunday night, then at least one more heavy\nsnowstorm on Monday, with another possible on Tuesday. If this\nimpressive series of storms stay as forecast, snow removal\nresources and operations will be pushed to their limits for a\nconsistent four-day period. The Idaho transportation system at the\nstate, county and municipal level will undergo severe impacts,\nespecially during the upcoming weekend.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 7\ninches possible.\n\n* WHERE...Eastern Magic Valley, the Snake River Plain, Mud Lake\nDesert, and Southern Hills.\n\n* WHEN...From Friday evening through Saturday evening.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Travel could be very difficult to\nimpossible both at airfields and on highways, roads, and\nstreets. Winds will drift snow shortly after efforts to clear\nroads have occurred.",
