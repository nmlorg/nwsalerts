Near\nblizzard conditions may be possible for St. Lawrence Island with\nblowing snow and potential for visibilities of a quarter to half\nmile visibility. There is still uncertainty of the strength of\nwinds, but could possibly reach sustained winds of 35 mph with\ngusts to 55 mph. These conditions will continue into early next\nweek as the northeast winds persist.\n\nPlease take proper precautions prior to the deteriorating\nconditions that are expected to develop later this weekend and\ncontinuing into early next week.
