Heavy rain has ended across the county with only\nlight rainfall expected overnight. However, storm-total rainfall\nof 5-7 inches county wide is producing runoff that is still\ncausing rises on larger streams including Twelvemile Creek\nnear Liberty and Eighteenmile Creek north of Pendleton.\nSignificant flooding is ongoing on these larger streams and\nthis flooding is expected to persist through the overnight\nhours as it will take some time for these streams to crest and\nrecede.  Elevated stream levels are expected to persist into\nFriday morning. Therefore, though the flash flood threat has\nended for this event, a Flood Warning has been issued to\ncontinue to highlight numerous ongoing flooding impacts.\n\n* Numerous roads will remain closed across the warned area.\nDO NOT DRIVE THROUGH FLOODED ROADWAYS. Please obey all barricades.\nIt is extremely difficult at night to assess the depth of flooding\nand roads may be damaged or washed away underneath the flood\nwaters.  Barricades remain in place until engineers can assess\nthe stability of the road or bridge and ensure its safety.\n\n* Some locations that may continue to experience flooding include...\nEasley, Clemson, Pickens, Central, Liberty, Norris, Six Mile,\nJocassee Gorges, Lake Jocassee and Table Rock State Park.",
        "instruction": "Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the\ndangers of flooding.\n\nNumerous roads, parking lots and bridges were impacted by\nflash flooding. Please pay close attention to road signs indicating\na flood-prone area. Obey all barricades, even if water is not\ncurrently over the road. Barricades are in place for your\nprotection and indicate areas where flooding can occur rapidly\nand without warning.",
