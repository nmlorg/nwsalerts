Untreated roads will become partially to completely snow-\ncovered and slippery for the morning commute. Additional snow\naccumulations around a half inch to an inch are likely through 8\nAM, greatest across far southwest Wisconsin and northeast Iowa. In\naddition, visibility may be reduced to less than one mile at\ntimes.\n\nAllow extra time for your morning commute and drive slower with\ncaution on snow-covered roads. Check the latest road conditions\nfor your state before heading out by visiting 511wi.gov,\n511ia.org, or 511mn.org.",
