        "instruction": "A Heavy Freezing Spray Warning means heavy freezing spray is\nexpected to rapidly accumulate on vessels. These conditions can\nbe extremely hazardous to navigation. It is recommended that\nmariners not trained to operate in these conditions or vessels\nnot properly equipped to do so...remain in port or avoid the\nwaring area.\n\nA Gale Warning means winds of 34 to 47 knots are imminent or\noccuring. Operating a vessel in gale conditions requires\nexperience and properly equipped vessels. It is highly\nrecommended that mariners without the proper experience seek safe\nharbor prior to the onset of gale conditions.",
