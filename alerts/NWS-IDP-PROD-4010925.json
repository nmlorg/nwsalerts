        "description": "Wet ground from recent precipitation, and mostly clear to partly\ncloudy skies, are combining with light winds to produce\nwidespread fog across much of the region. The fog is dense in the\nvalleys, as well as on some midslope and ridgetop locations.\nClouds are expected to increase through the night, which should\nhelp to decrease the coverage of the fog, especially across the\nfar southeast portion of the state.\n\nIf traveling overnight, be prepared for visibilities below a\nquarter mile at times and longer travel times. Use low beam\nheadlights. Slow down and allow extra distance between you and the\nvehicle in front of you.",
