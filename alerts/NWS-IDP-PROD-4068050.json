        "description": "Rainfall coverage and intensity will increase across the region\nearly this morning as a low pressure system begins to shift eastward\nacross the northern Gulf of Mexico. As the lower portion of the\natmosphere cools, conditions will become increasingly favorable for\nrain to transition to a mixture of rain and snow between 9 and 11 AM\nCST, with this mixture expected to continue until precipitation ends\nthis afternoon. Minor snowfall accumulations will be possible in\nelevations above 1500 ft, with a few locations atop the Cumberland\nPlateau perhaps receiving 1 to 2 inches of snow. Although\naccumulating snow will generally be confined to grassy and elevated\nsurfaces, a few slick spots could develop on local roads, and\nmotorists are urged to use caution if traveling in these areas this\nmorning.",
