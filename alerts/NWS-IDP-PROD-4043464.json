        "description": "Multiple periods of rainfall since the first of January have\nincreased soil moisture to high levels across Western Washington.\nRainfall amounts have been generally in the 1 to 3 inch range\nover the last 24 hours with locally higher amounts of 4 to 7 inches\nfor portions of the Cascades. An additional 0.25 to 1.0 inches of\nrainfall is expected through Friday with locally higher amounts\npossible in the mountains. This amount of rain will put extra\npressure on soil instability, leading to an increased threat of\nlandslides being triggered through the period and immediately after.\n\nMultiple landslides have already been reported in various locations\nin western Washington, especially across King, Pierce, and Snohomish\nCounties. More landslides are possible.\n\nFor more information about current conditions, visit\nwww.weather.gov/seattle, select Hydrology, and then scroll down\nfor the links to the landslide information pages.\n\nFor more information on landslides, visit the website for the\nWashington State Department of Natural Resources landslide\ngeologic hazards at: http://bit.ly/2mtA3wn",
