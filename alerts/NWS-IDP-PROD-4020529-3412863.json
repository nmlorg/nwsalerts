        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nEast Fork White River...Eel River...Wabash River...White River...\n\n\n.Minor to moderate flooding continued Sunday morning in central and\nsouthern Indiana on the major rivers.  Crests will be/are comparable\nto those that occurred in February and June of 2019.  Minor\nflooding developed late Saturday afternoon on the Eel River that\nwill come to an end this afternoon.\n\nA mix of precipitation Friday and Saturday totaled as high as\napproximately 1.50 inches, which will slow river falls or bring\nlower secondary crests on the major rivers, and produce additional\nminor flooding on smaller ones.  Flooding has returned to Seymour on\nthe East Fork White River, and this afternoon it will return to\nSpencer on the White River.  The Driftwood River near Edinburgh will\nbe near bankfull, with a crest near flood stage Sunday morning.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers will\ncontinue until about Wednesday, January 29.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is forecast through midday Thursday.  This\nwill give area waterways several days to drain and return to near\nnormal levels.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Clinton.\n* until Thursday morning.\n* There have been no observations in the last 24 hours.\n* Flood stage is 18.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It is forecast to crest at 21.1 feet late tonight and\nwill fall below flood stage by Wednesday evening.\n* At 21.0 feet...Lowland flooding in progress.  River water runs\nthrough the City of Clinton's wastewater treatment plant.",
