A\ndecrease in physical activity is recommended.\n\nConsolidate your travel, reduce or eliminate fireplace use, refrain\nfrom outdoor burning, and avoid using gas-powered lawn equipment.\n\nFor details on this High Pollution Advisory for Maricopa County,\nvisit the ADEQ internet site at www.azdeq.gov or call 602-771-2300.",
