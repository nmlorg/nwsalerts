For the Gale Watch, from Friday evening through\nSaturday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds can cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",

If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible\nhazardous conditions.
