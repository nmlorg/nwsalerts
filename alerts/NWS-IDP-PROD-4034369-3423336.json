        "description": "...SNOW AND WIND TO IMPACT TRAVEL MONDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH\nTUESDAY AFTERNOON...\n\n.A band of moderate to heavy snow will push into the northern\nColorado mountains Monday afternoon resulting in very difficult\ntravel conditions. Snow showers will continue Monday night through\nTuesday afternoon.\n\nSnow will also spread onto the plains Monday and Monday night,\nand then continue into Tuesday as the storm system moves across\nthe state. Snow accumulations on the plains are expected to be\nlighter. However, a few inches of snow, and possible freezing\ndrizzle early in the event, will still result in travel impacts\nwith snow covered and slick road conditions. Plan ahead for the\nsharp change in temperatures and wintry travel conditions.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 14\ninches possible. Winds could gust as high as 45 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Rabbit Ears Pass, Rocky Mountain National Park and the\nMedicine Bow Range, The Mountains of Summit County, the\nMosquito Range, and the Indian Peaks, The Northern Front Range\nFoothills and The Southern Front Range Foothills.\n\n* WHEN...From Monday afternoon through Tuesday afternoon.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. The hazardous\nconditions could impact the morning or evening commutes. The\ncold wind chills as low as 30 below zero could cause frostbite\non exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.",
