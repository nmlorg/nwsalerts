The heaviest snow fell over Rabbit Ears Pass and to the\nnorth, while parts of Summit County weren't too far behind. More\nsnow is expected this morning before the storm begins moving out\nof the state.  Gusty winds of 35 to 50 mph can also be expected\non mountain passes, with even higher winds in backcountry areas.\nThe winds will produce blowing and drifting snow with reduced\nvisibilities. Additional accumulations should be less than 4 to 6\ninches, but travel conditions will still be hazardous due to the\ncombination of snow that fell overnight and anticipated additional\nsnowfall.\n\n* WHAT...Snow with additional snow accumulations of 3 to 6\ninches. Winds gusting as high as 50 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Rabbit Ears Pass and to the north.\n\n* WHEN...Until noon MST today.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel will be difficult at times, especially this\nmorning. Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce\nvisibility.",
