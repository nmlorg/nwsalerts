Although streams and\nrivers statewide will have elevated water levels, windward\nareas will be especially susceptible to flash flooding, as the\nground is saturated from recent incessant rainfall.\n\n* The extended period of rain could cause flooding in low spots\nwhich could make some roadways impassable. Debris in streams\nand gulches may clog bridges and culverts. Strong winds may\ncause trees and branches to fall, increasing the potential for\nlandslides.",

Do not cross fast\nflowing water in your vehicle or on foot.\n\nBe prepared to take action if a Flash Flood Warning is issued.
