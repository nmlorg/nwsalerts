Flooding along the lower reaches of\nthe Wabash and White Rivers currently are predicted to last until the\nend of next week.\n\nAn additional inch of rain is expected to fall over the next few\ndays which may prolong river flooding.\n\nFlood impacts should mainly be confined to roads near the waterways,\nagricultural land, bottom-lands, and levees.
