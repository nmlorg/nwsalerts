Crests are expected to be the\nhighest since either February or June of 2019.\n\nAs of Monday morning, flooding had ended along many of the smaller\nstreams with minor to moderate flooding occurring along the main\nstem rivers. The Wabash River was rising along the full length.  The\ncrest along the White River was near Ravenswood. The crest along the\nEast Fork White River was between Seymour and Rivervale. Flooding\nalong the lower portions of the White and Wabash River is likely to\ncontinue through the end of the month.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday which\nwill allow smaller rivers to continue to recede this week.\nAdditional heavy rainfall of 1 to 2 inches is possible this weekend\nwhich could exacerbate ongoing flooding.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Terre Haute.\n* until Tuesday January 21.\n* At  9:30 AM Monday the stage was 21.6 feet.
