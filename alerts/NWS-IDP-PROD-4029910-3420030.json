Those living in areas prone to flooding\nshould be prepared to take action should flooding develop.\n\nLandslides and debris flows are possible during this flood event.\nPeople, structures and roads located below steep slopes, in\ncanyons and near the mouths of canyons may be at serious risk\nfrom rapidly moving landslides.",
