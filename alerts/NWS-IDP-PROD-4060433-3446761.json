The waves\nwill likely peak around midday Saturday in the 10 to 13 foot\nrange. The waves on top of a push of water associated with the\nwind will result in significant beach and dune erosion. Flooding\nof low lying areas is possible, including back into river\nchannels.",
        "instruction": "Strong winds and high waves will continue to produce hazardous\nconditions on piers, breakwaters and unprotected shoreline so\ncaution is still advised until the winds and waves subside. Winds\nand waves of this magnitude produce moderate to severe beach\nerosion.",
