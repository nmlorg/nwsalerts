In west central Washington, King, Lewis, Pierce,\nSnohomish, and Thurston.\n\n* From this afternoon through Sunday morning\n\n* Several rounds of moderate to heavy rainfall into this weekend.\nRivers are expected to rise, with some rivers reaching flood\nstage as early as this evening. Snow levels will be around 6,000\nto 8,000 feet through tonight. Heavy rainfall may also cause\nperiods of minor urban flooding. The exact placement of heaviest\nrainfall this afternoon into tonight remains uncertain and will\nhave a direct influence on the magnitude and placement of\nflooding. Widespread minor to moderate river flooding is most\nlikely, but major flooding is also possible. Rivers from King\nCounty northward are at greatest risk of reaching moderate to\nmajor flood severity.",
