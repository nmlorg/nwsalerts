        "description": "A weak storm system will bring gusty winds across the eastern\nSierra into western Nevada this afternoon and evening. Wind gusts\nof 35 to 45 mph are expected across eastern California and far\nwestern Nevada. A short period of stronger wind gusts over 50 mph\nare likely along the I-580/US-395 corridor from eastern Lassen\nCounty southward across Reno, Washoe Valley, and into far northern\nMono County. For the Sierra ridges, gusts up to 90 mph are\nexpected.\n\nThese winds may produce travel restrictions for high profile\nvehicles, along with rough lake conditions and areas of turbulence\nfor aviation.\n\nIn addition, light snowfall could produce travel impacts for the\nmain Sierra passes west of Lake Tahoe this afternoon and evening.\nSnowfall totals up to 3 inches are expected for Donner Summit,\nEcho Summit, and Carson Pass. Lighter snowfall, generally an inch\nor less, could reach parts of the Lake Tahoe basin, Mt. Rose\nSummit, the Surprise Valley, and near the Sierra crest in Mono\ncounty.\n\nAcross western Nevada, most areas will be shadowed out of rain and\nsnow, except for a period of light rain and snow in far northern\nWashoe County through tonight.",
