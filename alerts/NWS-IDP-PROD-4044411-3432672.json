Flooding\nwill linger through the early morning hours, especially along\nparts of Johns River Road and Corpening Bridge Road.  On Lake\nRhodhiss, flooding of docks and yards will continue.  Also, watch\nfor rising waters between the lake and Morganton.  Backwater\nflooding along Silver and Lower Creeks is possible as well.",

Only a few\ninches of rapidly flowing water can carry away your vehicle. It is\nnot worth the risk. Please TURN AROUND, DON'T DROWN.\n\nBe especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the\ndangers of flooding.",
