Precipitation is expected to\nstart off as light snow...with a mix of snow, freezing rain and\npossibly sleet mixed in at times late tonight through the midday\nhours Wednesday. This could result in a light glaze of ice on area\nroadways.\n\nAt this time, snow accumulations up to two inches will be\npossible, with the highest amounts favoring areas southeast of\nthe Tri Cities. Total ice accumulations are expected to be only a\nfew hundredths of an inch.\n\nThere is still some forecast uncertainty, but if current trends\ncontinue, a Winter Weather Advisory may become warranted for\nportions of the area later today.",
