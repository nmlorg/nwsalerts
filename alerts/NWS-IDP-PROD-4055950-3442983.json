East of this area,\nwinds will remain high, but visibilities are not expected to drop\nto blizzard criteria, but areas of blowing snow will continue.\n\nPlummeting temperatures this afternoon and evening may lead to\nflash freezing of this light snow on roadways and surfaces, with\nimpacts to the evening commute expected.\n\nTemperatures will continue to drop off sharply behind the Arctic\nfront. Wind chill values will average 25 to 35 degrees below zero\nover west central Minnesota, with wind chills of 35 to 40 degrees\nbelow zero likely by the evening. These dangerous wind chills will\ncontinue into mid-morning Thursday. In eastern Minnesota, into\nwestern Wisconsin, wind chills will drop to between 25 and 35\ndegrees below zero late tonight, and through Thursday morning.\n\n* WHAT...For the Blizzard Warning, blizzard conditions expected.\nLittle or no additional snow accumulations.
