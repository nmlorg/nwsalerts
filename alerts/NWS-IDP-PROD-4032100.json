By\nmid-morning, temperatures should quickly warm above freezing for\nthe entire area. Dense fog is occurring and will continue to\noccur through mid-morning on the Caprock and adjacent areas just\nto the east. Where temperatures are below freezing, this fog may\nbecome freezing fog. The potential also exists for freezing\ndrizzle in these areas. Though measurable precipitation is not\nexpected at this time, a light glaze, especially on elevated\nsurfaces (such as bridges and overpasses), may develop. This may\nlead to slippery road conditions. Caution is advised on area\nroads...take it slow.",
