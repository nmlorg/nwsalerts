        "description": "Light snow or flurries will continue at times into early Thursday\nmorning. Any additional accumulation should be less than an inch,\nexcept for locally higher amounts across the snowbelt region of\nnorthwest Vilas County.\n\nThe combination of new snow, or melting snow on pavement surfaces\nfrom yesterday afternoon will continue to cause untreated roads,\nbridges, parking lots and sidewalks to be snow or ice covered.\nGusty northerly winds may also create some areas of blowing and\ndrifting snow.\n\nTemperatures around daybreak on Thursday are expected to fall\ninto the single digits below zero. The combination of the cold\ntemperatures and gusty northerly winds will produce wind chill\nreadings in the 15 below to 25 below zero range late tonight into\nThursday morning. Wind chill readings this low can produce frost\nbite within 30 minutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving tonight, as roads\nwill be slippery due to ice or snow. If venturing outdoors, wear\nlayers of clothing along with a hat and gloves to protect yourself\nfrom the bitter cold.",
