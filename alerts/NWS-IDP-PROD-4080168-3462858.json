For maximum safety...swim near a lifeguard.\nPay attention to flags and signs.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current...yell for help. Remain\ncalm...do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current...swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.",
