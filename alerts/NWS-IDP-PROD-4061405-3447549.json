As a result of excess water passing though each\nlake, the pool height at Mountain Island Lake should hover around\n101.5 feet today and tonight. This will continue to result in\nnuisance shoreline flooding of lake access areas, docks, and\nresidential yards along and downstream of the lake.\n\n* Residents should closely monitor lake levels for sudden changes,\nand follow guidance from Charlotte-Mecklenburg Emergency\nManagement. Drivers are encouraged to heed any barricades and\navoid all flooded areas.\n\n* For more information on lake levels or dam releases, people are\nencouraged to visit http://lakes.duke-energy.com, call 1-800-829-\n5253, or download the Duke Energy Lake View mobile app.",
