Plan on slippery road\nconditions tonight, especially in areas where wet roads refreeze\nin falling temperatures. Areas of blowing snow will\nsignificantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions could\nimpact the morning commute. Gusty winds could bring down tree\nbranches, so isolated power outages will be possible.",
