The crest along the East Fork White River was\nbetween Seymour and Rivervale. Flooding along the lower portions of\nthe White and Wabash River is likely to continue through the end of\nthe month.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday which\nwill allow smaller rivers to continue to recede this week.\nAbove normal precipitation is possible this coming Friday\ninto Saturday, which could exacerbate elevated water levels on area\nwaterways.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Lafayette.\n* until Saturday evening.\n* At  8:30 PM Monday the stage was 17.4 feet.\n* Flood stage is 11.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by\nSaturday morning.\n* At 17.0 feet...Lowland flooding in progress.
