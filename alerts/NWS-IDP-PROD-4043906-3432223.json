        "description": "...The Flood Warning has ended for the following rivers in\nWashington...\n\nPilchuck River Near Snohomish affecting Snohomish County\n\n...The Flood Warning continues for the following rivers in\nWashington...\n\nGreen River Near Auburn affecting King County\n\n\nThis is an updated river forecast for the Green River. Howard Hanson\nDam regulation lowered outflows for a time this afternoon but it\nwill ramp back up. This allowed the Green river to recede for a time\nthis afternoon but it will go back up again tonight.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Green River Near Auburn\n* From 12 AM Thursday until Saturday afternoon.\n* At  4:45 PM Thursday the flow was 7540 cfs.\n* Flood flow is 9000 cfs.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...the river crested at 10400 cfs at 10:15 this morning\nthen fell below flood stage temporarily at 2:50 PM and has\ncontinued to fall. The river will begin to rise again around\n9:00 PM tonight and go back above flood stage after midnight.\n* Impact...At 10000 cfs, the Green River will flood low areas of the\nmiddle Green River valley with water over SE Green Valley Rd.  Some\nflooding is possible at a few low spots along the banks of the\nGreen River in Auburn, including near Issac Evans Park in lower\nMill Creek basin between Auburn and Kent due to backwater. A flow\nof 9000 cfs feet on the Green River corresponds to a phase 3 flood\nin the King County flood system.",
