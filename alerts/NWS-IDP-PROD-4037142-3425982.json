This\nwill allow the storm to produce snowfall over north central and\nnortheast Colorado for several more hours than previously\nforecast. As light to moderate snow continues overnight, snow-\ncovered roads will be the result. The Tuesday morning commute\npromises to be a slow because of slippery, snow-covered roads and\npossibly poor visibility due to falling snow. Improving conditions\nare not expected until Tuesday afternoon. As the storm moves out\nTuesday night, the coldest temperatures of the week are expected\nWednesday morning. Residents who have to travel Tuesday morning should\ngive themselves plenty of extra time.\n\n* WHAT...Moderate to heavy snow expected. Additional snow\naccumulations of 6 to 12 inches. Winds gusting as high as 40\nmph.\n\n* WHERE...The Mountains of Summit County, the Mosquito Range,\nand the Indian Peaks and Rocky Mountain National Park and the\nMedicine Bow Range.\n\n* WHEN...Until 2 PM MST Tuesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Patchy blowing snow\ncould significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions\nwill impact the morning commute. The cold wind chills as low as\n25 below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as\nlittle as 30 minutes.",
