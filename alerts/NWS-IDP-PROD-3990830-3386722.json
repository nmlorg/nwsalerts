For the Small Craft Advisory,\nwest winds 15 to 25 knots with gusts up to 30 knots and waves\n1 to 4 feet expected.\n\n* WHERE...Oak Point to Saxon Harbor WI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 10 AM\nTuesday to 6 AM CST Wednesday. For the Small Craft Advisory,\nfrom 10 PM this evening to 4 AM CST Wednesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
