In\nnortheast Georgia...Towns and White. In northwest Georgia...\nBartow...Catoosa...Chattooga...Dade...Floyd...Gordon...\nMurray...Polk...Walker and Whitfield.\n\n* From this evening through Thursday afternoon\n\n* A cold front will push through Georgia tonight through Thursday.\nThis front will bring another round of locally heavy rainfall to\nmuch of north Georgia. Rainfall amounts of one to two inches\nwill be likely, with locally higher amounts possible. Soils\nremain saturated and several rivers, creeks and streams remain\nnear or in flood, so any additional rainfall will only create\nrun off and exacerbate ongoing flooding conditions.\n\n* Flash flooding and minor to moderate flooding of larger creeks\nand rivers is expected. This will close some roads and could\nflood homes and businesses in flood-prone areas. Along larger\ncreeks and rivers, flooding could last for several days.",
        "instruction": "A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead\nto flash flooding. Flash flooding is a very dangerous situation.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action\nshould Flash Flood Warnings be issued.",
