For the Gale\nWatch, southwest winds 25 to 40 kt and seas 13 to 17 feet at 15 or\n16 seconds possible.\n\n* WHERE...Coastal Waters from Cape Flattery to Cape Shoalwater out\nto 60 nm.\n\n* WHEN...For the Small Craft Advisory, until noon PST Thursday. For\nthe Gale Watch, from Thursday afternoon through late Friday night.\n\n* IMPACTS...Strong winds can cause hazardous seas which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "A Small Craft Advisory means that wind speeds of 21 to 33 knots\nand/or seas 10 feet or higher are expected to produce hazardous\nwave conditions to small craft. Inexperienced mariners,\nespecially those operating smaller vessels should avoid\nnavigating in these conditions.\n\nA Gale Watch is issued when the risk of gale force winds of 34 to\n47 knots has significantly increased, but the specific timing\nand/or location is still uncertain. It is intended to provide\nadditional lead time for mariners who may wish to consider\naltering their plans.",
