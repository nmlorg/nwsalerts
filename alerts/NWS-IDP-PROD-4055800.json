The fog bank extends\noffshore up to 40 NM. Visibility will be below 1 NM at times. Later\nthis afternoon, the fog may begin to move back onshore as winds\nshift more southeast with the east coast sea breeze, then the fog\nwould impact inland estuaries.",
        "instruction": "Mariners can expect gusty winds to around 30 knots, locally higher\nwaves, and lightning strikes. Boaters should seek safe harbor\nimmediately until this storm passes.\n\nDense fog was reducing visibilities to below 1 mile. Reduce your\nspeed, and keep a lookout for other vessels, buoys, and breakwaters.\nKeep your navigation lights on. If not equipped with radar, you\nshould consider seeking safe harbor.",
