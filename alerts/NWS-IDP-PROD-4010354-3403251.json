Flooding has ended along most of the creeks and\nsmaller rivers.  Flooding is the result of up to about 4 inches of\nrain that fell late last week.\n\nThe large majority of the Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers\nare either in flood or expected to flood, with some locations\nreaching moderate flood stage.  Crests are expected to be the\nhighest since either February or June of 2019.\n\nThe Wabash River is cresting or past crest from Covington to Terre\nHaute.  The crest on the White River was between Elliston and\nNewberry.  The crest along the East Fork White River was between\nSeymour and Rivervale. Flooding along the lower portions of the White\nand Wabash River is likely to continue through the end of the month.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday,\nwhich will allow drainage to continue out of area rivers this week.\nAbove normal precipitation is possible this coming Friday into\nSaturday, which could exacerbate elevated water levels and lead to\nrenewed flooding on area waterways.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Riverton.\n* until Friday January 24.\n* At  6:00 PM Tuesday the stage was 18.8 feet.\n* Flood stage is 15.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will rise to near 20.7 feet by Friday afternoon then\nbegin falling. It will fall below flood stage Friday January 24.\n* At 20.7 feet...Leaverton Park at Palestine, Illinois extensively\nfloods including the campground area.  Rodeo area still dry at this\nlevel. Most if not all local unimproved roads leading to the Wabash\nRiver in the Palestine area are impassable by any land vehicle.\nExtensive backwater flooding of Minnow Slough, Sugar Creek and\nLamotte Creek in Palestine area. Numerous river cabins surrounded\nby water across the river from Merom Bluff. Backyards of a few\nresidences southeast of Palestine along East River Road flood.",
