        "description": "A low pressure system moving rapidly across the region today will\ninteract with the chilly airmass in place to produce light snow\ninto the afternoon hours. Accumulations will be possible by the\nafternoon, with a half inch of snow in the mountain valleys to\nnearly 2 inches along the higher mountain ridges, and a dusting to\na half inch across the Piedmont of South Carolina and northeast\nGeorgia, and the foothills of North Carolin. Accumulations would\nmainly affect grassy and elevated surfaces, but light\naccumulations are possible on colder road surfaces such as bridges\nand overpasses.\n\nMost locations will see temperatures climb above freezing today,\nbut likely stay locked in the 30s. Significant travel impacts are\nnot expected, but a few locations could see temperatures hover\nnear the freezing mark for a good part of the day. A few slippery\nspots could develop on area roadways, especially across portions\nof the north Carolina mountains and foothills.",
