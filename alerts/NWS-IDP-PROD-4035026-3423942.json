To prevent\nfreezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should\nbe wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have\nin-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-\nground pipes to protect them from freezing.\n\nIf driving, slow down, use your headlights, and leave plenty of\ndistance ahead of you.",
