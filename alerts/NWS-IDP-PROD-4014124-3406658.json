In Missouri, Barry, Barton, Benton, Camden, Cedar,\nChristian, Dade, Dallas, Dent, Douglas, Greene, Hickory,\nHowell, Jasper, Laclede, Lawrence, Maries, McDonald, Miller,\nMorgan, Newton, Oregon, Ozark, Phelps, Polk, Pulaski, Shannon,\nSt. Clair, Stone, Taney, Texas, Vernon, Webster, and Wright.\n\n* From Friday morning through late Friday night\n\n* Widespread rainfall is expected to range from roughly an inch\nto an inch and three quarters. Soil conditions along with the\nlack of vegetation in the winter time will also contribute to\nflooding of small streams, creeks, and rivers.\n\n* Flooding of low water crossings and low lying roadways near\nstreams, creeks, and rivers is expected to occur.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
