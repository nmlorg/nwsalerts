This freezing drizzle transition will\ncontinue into western Wisconsin tonight. Freezing drizzle will\nlast 3 to 5 hours at any one location before transitioning back to\nsnow for the rest of the storm. Additional snow accumulations of\n1 to 3 inches through Saturday morning are expected, which will\nbring storm total snowfall up to 4 to 7 inches across the area.\n\nBlowing snow, with significant reductions in visibility will\noccur early Saturday morning over western Minnesota as winds\nincrease from the northwest. The worst conditions will occur in\nwest central, and into south central Minnesota through the day\nSaturday. Surface visibility will be near zero at times,\nespecially in open country. In addition, falling temperatures will\nlead to icy roads and very cold temperatures.\n\n* WHAT...Mix of freezing drizzle and snow tonight. Blowing and\ndrifting snow on Saturday. Additional snow accumulations of 1 to\n3 inches and ice accumulations of a light glaze. Northwest winds\ngusting as high as 35 mph Saturday will result in blowing snow\nand reduced visibilities in open areas.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of northwest and west central Wisconsin and\ncentral, east central, south central and southeast Minnesota.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
