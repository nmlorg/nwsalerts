        "description": "A very strong cold front moving up Cook Inlet will bring back\nwinter in a hurry this evening and tonight as temperatures plummet\nrapidly and snow begins to accumulate from the southern Kenai\nPeninsula northward to the Matanuska Valley. In the afternoon,\nstrong southwest winds and extremely cold arctic air will impact\nKachemak Bay and the southern Kenai, and this will support areas\nof blizzard conditions given the ocean-enhanced snow showers\nforming along Cook Inlet. By late evening, expect heavy snow to be\nimpacting areas from Anchorage to the Matanuska Valley. The\ncombination of rapidly cooling temperatures and periods of heavy\nsnow will likely result in potentially hazardous travel conditions\nas this colder air quickly moves into the Susitna Valley and\nCopper Basin by Wednesday morning as temps fall throughout the day\nacross all of Southcentral.",
