At least one\nroad has already been closed. 2 to 4 inches of rain have fallen\nsince Sunday evening, with steady rainfall continuing today.\nDrainage systems may become overwhelmed with the additional\nrainfall. Flooded roadways will become increasingly widespread\nthrough the day.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nGreenwood, Ware Shoals, Ninety Six, Cokesbury, Hodges, Troy, Lake\nGreenwood State Park, Greenwood State Park and Ninety Six Historic\nSite.",
        "instruction": "Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Do not attempt to cross\nwater-covered roadways, bridges, or low-level crossings. Only a few\ninches of rapidly flowing water can carry away your vehicle. It is\nnot worth the risk. Please TURN AROUND, DON'T DROWN.\n\nExcessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of small\ncreeks and streams, country roads, as well as farmland, drainages,\nand other low-lying areas.\n\nNumerous roads, parking lots and bridges will be threatened by heavy\nrain and rapidly rising streams and creeks. Please pay close\nattention to road signs indicating a flood-prone area. Obey all\nbarricades, even if water is not currently over the road. Barricades\nare in place for your protection and indicate areas where flooding\ncan occur rapidly and without warning.\n\nOnly when it is safe to do so, please report floodwaters or\nlandslides flowing over roads or threatening property to the National\nWeather Service by calling toll-free, 1, 800, 2 6 7, 8 1 0 1, by\nposting on our Facebook page, or via Twitter using hashtag NWSGSP.\nYour message should describe the event and the specific location\nwhere it occurred, including roadways, nearby cross streets, stream\nnames and other landmarks.",
