        "description": "...The biggest impact continues to be the wind. We have\ncold, northerly winds dropping down from the Montana divide. The\nnortherly winds have now made it through Pocatello and are\nexpected to continue to move southward this afternoon through the\nevening. These northerly winds are gusting to around 30 mph,\nstronger around 40 mph, across INL. These winds most likely have\npeaked now and should gradually decrease this afternoon into the\nearly evening. There is still blowing and drifting occurring\ncreating hazardous conditions, especially for Highway 20 from\nIdaho Falls to the INL complex as well as for Highway 33 from\nTeton to Tetonia. These highways will continue to receive very\nimpactful blowing and drifting before the winds taper off by late\nafternoon into early evening. Also, I-86 is seeing some blowing\nand drifting due to a direct cross wind though gusts are slightly\nless, around 30 mph currently. Because of the blowing and drifting\nsnow, have left the winter advisories and warnings out as there\nare other localized areas having impacts as well. We may be able\nto let the advisories and warnings go by late this afternoon, if\nnot early evening. Driving is still hazardous with these windy\nconditions creating the blowing and drifting of snow...\n\n* WHAT...Light snow. Additional snow accumulations of 1 to 4\ninches. Heavier amounts will be for mountains, especially the\nWasatch mountains. Winds gusting as high as 35 mph will be the\nbiggest impacts creating blowing and drifting snow.\n\n* WHERE...The south central highlands, Bear Lake region, Caribou\nHighlands, and Big Hole Mountains, including but not limited to\nVictor, Pine Creek Pass, Swan Valley, Inkom, McCammon, Malad,\nPreston, Lava Hot Springs, Fish Creek Summit, Soda Springs,\nGeorgetown Summit, Montpelier, Geneva Summit, Border Summit, and\nEmigration Summit.\n\n* WHEN...Until 8 PM MST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions mainly due to blowing\ndrifting snow. The hazardous conditions could impact the\nevening commute.",
