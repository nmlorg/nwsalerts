Low-lying\nroads may be closed due to high water.\n\nHistorically, similar conditions in the past have resulted in the\nminor flooding of Highway 101 near Seaside, Nehalem, and/or\nTillamook. Water has covered parts of Frazier Rd, Miami Foley Rd\nat milepost 1, as well as the intersection near Alderbrook and\nPossetti road.",
