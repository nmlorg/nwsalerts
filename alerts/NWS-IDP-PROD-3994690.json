        "description": "Areas of mixed precipitation, mostly in the form of freezing\ndrizzle, will develop mid to late morning and persist into the\nmid afternoon before turning to drizzle or ending. Temperatures\nwill be below freezing as the precipitation begins, then slowly\nrise above freezing during the afternoon. The tail end of the\nmorning commute may be impacted. Conditions should improve by the\nevening commute with precipitation ending and temperatures a\ndegree or two above freezing.\n\nIce accumulation will be light, generally around a few hundredths\nof an inch or less. However, any amount of ice can create very\nhazardous conditions on untreated pavement and surfaces. Be aware\nof the potential for icy spots on roads, bridges, and sidewalks.",
