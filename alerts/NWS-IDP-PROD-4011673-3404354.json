Flooding along the lower portions of the White\nand Wabash River is likely to continue until the weekend of\nJanuary 25.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday,\nwhich will allow drainage to continue out of area rivers this week.\nAbove normal precipitation is possible this coming Friday through\nSaturday, which could exacerbate elevated water levels and lead to\nrenewed flooding on area waterways.  Precipitation is expected to\nstart off as snow then transition to rain late Friday into Friday\nnight.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River at Shoals.\n* until late Sunday night.\n* At  8:30 AM Wednesday the stage was 19.9 feet.\n* Flood stage is 20.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...Rise above flood stage by this morning and continue to\nrise to near 22.9 feet by Friday afternoon.
