By Wednesday the main upper\nlevel system will approach Alabama and the threat of heavier\nrainfall will increase. The highest rainfall totals through Thursday\nwill be across areas south of Interstate 20, where 3 to 5 inches are\nforecast. Along and north of Intestate 20, rainfall amounts are\nforecast to be between 2 and 3 inches. With many areas experiencing\nwell above normal rainfall for the month of February, any additional\nheavy rainfall could result in flash flooding and river flooding.\n\nInterests across Central Alabama are urged to monitor the latest\nforecasts and be prepared to take protective actions if flooding\ndevelops.",
