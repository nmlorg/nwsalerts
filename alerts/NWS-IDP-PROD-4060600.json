Locations include, but are not limited\nto Denver, Boulder, Longmont, and Greeley.\n\nWHEN...400 PM Friday February 14 to 400 PM Saturday February 15\n\nIMPACTS...An Action Day for Particulates and Visibility is now in\neffect for the seven-county Denver-Boulder metropolitan area.\nRequests to limit driving are now in effect until at least 4 PM\nSaturday, February 15, 2020.  Limited mixing and ventilation has\nincreased fine particulate concentrations across portions of the\nNorthern Front Range Urban Corridor. Unhealthy for Sensitive\nGroups level fine particulate matter concentrations are possible\non Friday, decreasing during the day Saturday, with Poor\nvisibility is expected Saturday. For areas included in this\nadvisory that are not expected to exceed the Unhealthy for\nSensitive Groups (USG) air quality designation, we request that\nactivities, such as driving, be reduced to lessen the impacts on\nneighboring air quality. Additional air pollution in this region\nmay directly diminish air quality or contribute to precursors\nwhich may also adversely affect air quality.
