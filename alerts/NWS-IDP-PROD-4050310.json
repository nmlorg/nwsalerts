As a result, two separate rounds of heavy rain will\naffect the area through the upcoming week. The first of these will\noccur Monday and Monday night, with the second one expected from\nTuesday night through Thursday. This rain will fall on already saturated\nground, with the heaviest rainfall amounts expected to occur across the far\nsouthern and southeast portion of the state, regions that have already\nbeen hard hit by our most recent heavy rain and flooding event. The\nadditional rainfall will lead to renewed and rapid rises on area creeks,\nstreams, and rivers, and may set the stage for more flooding, including\nalong the Cumberland River.\n\nStay tuned to the latest forecast updates over the next few days.",
