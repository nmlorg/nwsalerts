        "description": "A strong Pacific storm system remains forecast to move into the\nnorthern Rockies today, bringing a variety of winter weather\nhazards through Monday. First, snow is expected to begin across\nthe Central Mountains between 8 AM and 11 AM this morning,\nspreading southeast into the Wood River Valley and Lincoln County\nareas between 11 AM and 3 PM. The snow may briefly mix with rain\nsouth of Sun Valley before temperatures cool. Snow will continue\ninto Monday morning, accumulating 2 to 5 inches across most the\nCentral Mountains with locally up to 8 inches above pass level,\nand 1 to 3 inches in the Wood River Valley and Lincoln County.\nSecond, a strong cold front will blast across the region this\nafternoon and evening. If roads are wet, rapidly falling\ntemperatures behind the front may result in a flash freeze and icy\nconditions, especially on untreated roads. Finally, southwest\nwinds of 10 to 20 MPH gusting to 35 MPH are expected Sunday\nafternoon across Lincoln County, shifting into the northwest at 15\nto 20 MPH gusting to 35 MPH Monday. Winds across the Central\nMountains will largely be out of the north to northwest at similar\nspeeds at higher elevations, a bit lower in the valleys. Winds of\nthis magnitude may result in areas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nThe combination of a possible flash freeze, moderate snow, and\nblowing and drifting snow may result in hazardous travel\nconditions across the region, especially from this evening\nthrough Monday evening including the morning and evening commutes\nMonday. Snow covered and icy roads and reduced visibilities are\npossible.\n\nStay tuned to the latest updates and possible advisories from the\nNational Weather Service. If you are planning travel or commuting\nacross the region from this afternoon through Monday evening, plan\nextra time to reach your destination. Check Idaho 511 for road\nconditions, and slow down when encountering snow-covered or icy\nroads.",
