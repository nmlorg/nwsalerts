        "description": "Much warmer temperatures are headed to the Interior starting\nMonday and continuing through the week. Highs will be pushing\ninto the teens above to around 30 above, and lows will be in\nthe single digits above and below zero.\n\nA strong low pressure system will move into the Eastern Bering\nSea Monday and a weather front will move north to the Brooks\nRange. The low will move up the West Coast and dissipate Tuesday,\nbut another low will move in behind it mid week. Warm air will\nsurge north into the Interior as strong Chinook winds develop\nacross the Alaska Range Monday and Tuesday.\n\nPrecipitation will generally be west of the Interior with a slight\nchance of snow near the Brooks Range.\n\nAs the temperatures rise there is a high potential for frost to\ndevelop on the cold soaked roads of the Interior making traveling\nconditions difficult in the warmer locations.\n\nFor the latest Interior forecasts go to www.weather.gov/fairbanks.",
