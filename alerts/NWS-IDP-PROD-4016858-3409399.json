As the storm departs the region on Saturday, strong\nnorthwest winds will produce areas of blowing and drifting snow,\nespecially across northeast Iowa and southeast Minnesota along\nwith the higher terrain locations of western Wisconsin. Rapidly\ncooling temperatures will also cause wet roads to freeze during\nthe day.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow this afternoon and early evening changing to\na light wintry mix overnight and then light snow Saturday. Total\nsnow accumulations of 4 to 6 inches and ice accumulations of up\nto one tenth of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.\n\n* WHERE...In Wisconsin, Trempealeau, Buffalo and Jackson\nCounties. In Minnesota, Winona and Wabasha Counties.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Patchy blowing snow\ncould significantly reduce visibility.
