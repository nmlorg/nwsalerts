For the\nHeavy Freezing Spray Warning, heavy freezing spray at a rate\nof 2 cm per hour or greater expected, and may rapidly\naccumulate on vessels. For the Small Craft Advisory, west\nwinds 15 to 20 kt with gusts up to 30 kt and waves 3 to 6 feet\noccurring.\n\n* WHERE...Marquette to Munising MI, Huron Islands to Marquette\nMI, Munising to Grand Marais MI and Grand Marais to Whitefish\nPoint MI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, from 11 AM this morning to 9 AM\nEST Wednesday. For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 7 PM\nthis evening to 10 AM EST Wednesday. For the Small Craft\nAdvisory, until 11 AM EST this morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
