Flooding along the lower reaches of the Wabash\nand White Rivers currently are predicted to last until the end of\nnext week.\n\nThe latest forecast model data is now predicting flood crests along\nthe White River to be lower than what was predicted Monday morning.\nThis will give us crests lower than what we saw in January.\nPredictions for the Wabash are very similiar to Monday's\npredictions.\n\nFlood impacts should mainly be confined to roads near the waterways,\nagricultural land, bottomlands, and levees.  Please see the specific\nimpacts listed for your location of interest below or by going to\nthe web page described below.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River at Hazleton.\n* until further notice.\n* There have been no observations in the last 24 hours.\n* Flood stage is 16.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It is forecast to crest at 21.3 feet Tuesday February 18\nand will rise above flood stage by this afternoon.\n* At 22.0 feet...In agricultural season, extensive flooding of\nbottomlands and some of the higher bottomlands is in progress.\nHigh water surrounds Residents in river cabins.
