        "description": "A clipper-type system will move through the area late this\nafternoon and early evening. This system is expected to produce\nminor accumulations of light snowfall over westernmost parts of\nsoutheastern Missouri, especially in the higher elevations of the\nOzark Foothills. Up to a half inch of snowfall is possible in the\nhigher elevations. Some impacts to travel may occur there, as\nsnow will be more likely to stick to roads and elevated surfaces\nsuch as bridges and overpasses after nightfall. This may result in\nslick spots, especially on untreated, lesser traveled roadways.\n\nPlan on the possibility of slick spots on the evening commute.\nPlease slow down and use caution while driving.",
