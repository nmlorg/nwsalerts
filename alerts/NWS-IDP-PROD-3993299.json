While some areas will remain\ncompletely dry, a few localized areas may be impacted for a short\ntime. The concern will be for brief heavy snow, very poor\nvisibility, gusty winds and snow covered/icy roadways.\n\nThe focus for these localized snow squalls will be in the higher\nterrain, where temperatures will be colder. Motorists this\nafternoon should be prepared for localized slippery travel and\nvery poor visibility.",
