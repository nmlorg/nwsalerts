Travel could become nearly impossible.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures are expected to fall below\nfreezing early Saturday morning. There remains uncertainty where\nthe line of freezing temperatures and therefore freezing rain\nwill advance through the day Saturday, which will dictate which\nareas see the highest ice accumulations. Areas that do receive\nfreezing rain will likely see accumulations that will lead to\ntreacherous travel and the potential for extended power outages.\nAvoid travel Saturday if possible.",
