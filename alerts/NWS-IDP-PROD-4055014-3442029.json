This storm\nwill start as snow, but surface temperatures may warm up just\nenough to convert the precipitation type to rain or a rain/snow\nmix by the afternoon hours. This may lead to slushy roads today. This\nevening temperatures will fall back below freezing as a strong\ncold front moves through the area changing precipitation back to\nall snow. In addition, with temperatues falling quickly tonight,\nany wet surfaces and roadways are expected to flash freeze and\ncause further travel issues.\n\n* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3\ninches.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of east central Kansas and central and west\ncentral Missouri.\n\n* WHEN...Until midnight CST tonight.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
