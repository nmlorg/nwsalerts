        "description": "Multiple periods of rainfall since the first of January has\nincreased soil moisture to high levels across western Washington.\nRainfall amounts of up to 2 inches over the last 24 hours with locally\nhigher amounts of 3 to 4 inches for portions of the Cascades.\nAdditional rainfall through Friday with up 3 or more inches in the\nlowlands and foothills. This amount of rain will put extra pressure\non soil instability, leading to an increased threat of landslides\nbeing triggered through the period and immediately after.\n\nAreas above 5000 feet in elevation will see mostly snow and not be\naffected.\n\nA landslide has already been reported in Clallam County in western\nWashington near Beaver. More landslides are possible.\n\nFor more information about current conditions, visit\nwww.weather.gov/seattle, select Hydrology, and then scroll down\nfor the links to the landslide information pages.\n\nFor more information on landslides, visit the website for the\nWashington State Department of Natural Resources landslide\ngeologic hazards at: http://bit.ly/2mtA3wn",
