        "description": "Patchy freezing rain is possible through this afternoon across the\nsouthern St. Lawrence Valley and the northern Champlain Valley as\nprecipitation develops between noon and 3 PM. Surface temperatures\nremain near 30 degrees across western portions of St. Lawrence\nCounty New York, and untreated surfaces may become icy this\nafternoon. Likewise, a few areas near freezing in the northern\nChamplain Valley may yield icy spots this afternoon. Any ice\namounts will be minimal, and temperatures will generally be\nwarming several degrees above freezing late this afternoon,\nmitigating any prolonged periods of freezing rain.\n\nIf you are out traveling, please be aware that icy conditions may\nexist across the area and take appropriate precautions.",
