        "description": "Storm force winds of at least 48 kts will impact American Samoa\ncoastal waters tonight through Tuesday, as a complex environment\nwithin the active monsoon trough keeps the possibility of\na tropical cyclone developing over or near the islands. Also,\nseas are expected to reach up to 24 feet or higher Monday and\nMonday night, especially near thunderstorms.\n\nA storm warning means sustained winds of 48-63 kts (55-73 mph) or\ngreater, is either predicted or occurring, and not directly\nassociated with a tropical cyclone.\n\nStorm force winds and dangerous seas could capsize or damage\nvessels and the frequent showers could reduce visibility.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible hazardous\nconditions. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or\nsecure the vessel for severe wind and seas.\n\nListen to NOAA Weather Radio for the latest updates.\n\nYou may also follow us on Facebook \"NWSPagoPago\" or our website\nat www.weather.gov/ppg.",
