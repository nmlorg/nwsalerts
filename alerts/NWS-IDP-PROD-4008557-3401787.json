Flooding has ended along most of the creeks and smaller\nrivers.  Flooding is the result of up to about 4 inches of rain that\nfell late last week.\n\nThe large majority of the Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers\nare either in flood or expected to flood, with some locations\nreaching moderate flood stage.  Crests are expected to be the\nhighest since either February or June of 2019.\n\nThe Wabash River crested earlier today at Lafayette, Montezuma, and\nClinton.  The river will crest next around midnight Tuesday night at\nCovington and Terre Haute.  The crest on the White River was\napproaching Elliston.  The crest along the East Fork White River was\nbetween Seymour and Rivervale. Flooding along the lower portions of\nthe White and Wabash River is likely to continue through the end of\nthe month.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday which\nwill allow smaller rivers to continue to recede this week.\nAbove normal precipitation is possible this coming Friday\ninto Saturday, which could exacerbate elevated water levels on area\nwaterways.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Sugar Creek near Edinburgh.\n* until Tuesday morning.\n* At  9:00 PM Monday the stage was 10.6 feet.\n* Flood stage is 10.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by late\ntonight.\n* At 10.5 feet...Lowland flooding along Sugar Creek during March 2011.",
