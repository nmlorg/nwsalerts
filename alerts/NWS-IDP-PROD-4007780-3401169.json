Storm-total rainfall amounts of 2-4 inches occurred across\nmost of Greenwood County, with an area of 3-4.5 inches observed\ngenerally along a line from Bradley to Ninety-Six.\n\nSeveral roads remain closed, including:\nHunter Rd at County Line Rd;\nBethel Rd near Jordan Rd;\nDendy Bridge Rd near Indian Rd;\nWarner Rd at Old Hastings Rd;\nTillman Territory Rd at Kinard Rd;\nPaysinger Rd at Hwy 248;\nMcKenzie Rd; and\nTedards Store Rd;\n\nPlease obey all barricades, even where water isn't covering the\nroadway.  Roads and bridges must be inspected by engineers following\nflooding to ensure they were not compromised and barricades are in\nplace for your safety.\n\nOnly light showers are expected through this afternoon and early\nevening; therefore, the Flood Warning will be allowed to expire on\ntime. However, since several roads will remain flooded for several\nmore hours, a Flood Advisory will replace the Flood Warning and\nremain in effect through this evening.\n\nAdditional rounds of rainfall are expected tonight through early\ntomorrow morning which may exacerbate residual flooding or cause new\nflooding to develop. People in the Greenwood County area are advised\nto stay weather aware.",
        "instruction": "Numerous roads, parking lots and bridges will be threatened by heavy\nrain and rapidly rising streams and creeks. Please pay close\nattention to road signs indicating a flood-prone area. Obey all\nbarricades, even if water is not currently over the road. Barricades\nare in place for your protection and indicate areas where flooding\ncan occur rapidly and without warning.",
