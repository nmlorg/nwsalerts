        "description": "The cold over interior Alaska will linger into Saturday, then\nwarming temperatures late Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThe upper level ridge to the west, and the cold trough to the\neast that is digging west over the Central and Eastern Interior\nwill move east Saturday allowing warmer air to push north and east\ninto the Interior.\n\nTemperatures through Saturday will remain below normal with the\ndaily highs not much warmer than the lows. Some warmer air moving\nin aloft will not impact surface temperatures significantly, but\nwill make inversions stronger in the valleys.\n\nWinds will be picking up on summits along the Elliott and Dalton\nHighways today with Wind Chill around 55 below expected. Blowing\nand drifting snow is also expected and may impact travel over the\nsummits. Winds also increasing around Delta Junction, the Tanana\nFlats, and near Alaska Range Passes will bring Wind Chill as low\nas 55 below to those areas.\n\nFor the latest forecasts go to www.weather.gov/fairbanks.",
