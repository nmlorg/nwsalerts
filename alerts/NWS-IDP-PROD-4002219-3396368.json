The exception is the\nareas along the international border.\n\n* From 7 PM EST this evening through Sunday evening\n\n* Rainfall amounts from 1.5 to 2.5 inches are expected across far\nnorthern Vermont and northern New York with scattered totals to\nnear 3 inches in the northern St. Lawrence Valley. Amounts from\n0.75 to 1.5 inches are expected across the southern Adirondacks\ninto central and portions of northern Vermont with a third to\nthree quarters of an inch across most of southern Vermont with\nlocally higher totals. Additional snowmelt will combine with\nthis rainfall to enhance the potential for flooding in the Watch\narea.\n\n* Expect sharp rises on area waterways tonight into Sunday.\nSmaller rivers and streams and low lying areas will be most\nsusceptible to flooding along with some mainstem rivers. Some\nrivers may exceed minor to moderate flood stage Sunday\nafternoon due to snowmelt and rainfall. An isolated ice jam is\nalso possible but is of lesser concern.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
