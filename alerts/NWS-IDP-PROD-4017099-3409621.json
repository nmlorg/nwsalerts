        "description": "...Winter Storm Underway Through Saturday...\n\n.Widespread accumulating snow and a wintry mix of snow, sleet and\nfreezing rain at times, will continue to spread northeastward\nacross the area tonight through Saturday morning. Snow\naccumulations of 2 to 5 inches are likely, along with ice\naccumulations of up to two tenths of an inch. Locally higher\namounts of snow may occur in areas that remain in snow for longer\ndurations and at higher snowfall rates. There also may be a period\nof sleet accumulation. Strong southeast winds gusting up to 30 to\n35 MPH through this evening when combined with the falling\nprecipitation will further reduce visibilities and cause dangerous\ntraveling conditions.\n\nBy Saturday morning, very strong northwest winds gusting to 40 to\n45 MPH will lead to blowing and drifting snow with greatly\nreduced visibility. These winds will combine with falling\ntemperatures to produce wind chills down to 10 below zero to\n20 below zero during the evening hours Saturday.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy mixed precipitation expected. Total snow\naccumulations of 3 to 5 inches and ice accumulations of up to\none tenth of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph will\nproduce near whiteout conditions at times.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of east central, northeast and southeast Iowa\nand northwest Illinois.\n\n* WHEN...From noon Friday to 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing\nsnow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous\nconditions will impact the evening commute.",
        "instruction": "If you must travel, keep an extra flashlight, food, and water in\nyour vehicle in case of an emergency.\n\nIn Illinois, go to www.gettingaroundillinois.com for road\nconditions.\nIn Iowa, call 511 for road conditions.",
