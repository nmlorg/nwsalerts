Winds gusting as high as 35\nmph.\n\n* WHERE...St. Clair and Macomb Counties.\n\n* WHEN...From 4 AM Saturday to 7 AM EST Sunday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Difficult travel conditions are possible.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures are expected to fall to near\nfreezing early Saturday afternoon. There remains uncertainty\nwhere the line of freezing temperatures and therefore freezing\nrain will advance through the day Saturday, which will dictate\nwhich areas see the highest ice accumulations. Currently the\nfreezing line looks to stall across northern Macomb and St\nClair Counties resulting in a large gradient of ice accumulation\nfrom northwest to southeast across those counties.",
