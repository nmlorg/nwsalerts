The fog will begin to lift later today as daytime\nheating increases.\n\nMotorists are advised to drive with caution this morning across\nthe Northern Ranchlands as visibilities may change rapidly over\nshort distances. Use low beam headlights and leave extra distance\nbetween your vehicle and others on the road when encountering\nsignificant reductions in visibility. Allow extra time to travel\nto destinations.",
