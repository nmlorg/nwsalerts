The\nice jam starts roughly half a mile downstream of King Highway\nBridge, and extends toward Sprinkle Road. Parks and low-lying areas\nalong the river remain flooded. Residents that live on roads that\nback up to the river between the King Highway Bridge over the\nKalamazoo River and downtown Comstock should monitor conditions\nclosely as ice jams can cause rapidly fluctuating river levels.",
        "instruction": "Water levels around ice jams are notoriously unpredictable, and can\nchange quickly with little or no warning. Anyone living or recreating\nnear the river should pay close attention over the next few days and\nprepare for additional changes in water levels.",
