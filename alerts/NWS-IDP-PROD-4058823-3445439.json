Seas will initially be\ncomposed of a mix of 3 to 6 foot 10 second northwest swell and\nbuilding longer 18 second period west-northwest swell through\nFriday morning. Friday afternoon through Friday night northerly\nwind waves will build as winds increase to 15 to 25 knots south\nof Cape Blanco.

Advisory level winds are only expected for areas\nbetween 3 and 30 NM south of Cape Sebastian.\n\n* WHEN...From 4 AM Friday to 10 AM PST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Building long period swell early Friday morning\nthrough Friday afternoon is likely to increase the size of the\nsurf zone as more breakers occur. Use extra caution when\ncrossing bars, as they are likely to become especially\ndangerous. Additionally, gusty winds and/or steep seas could\ncapsize or damage smaller vessels.\n\n* View the hazard area in detail at\nhttps://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mfr/HAZARD",
