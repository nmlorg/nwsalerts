For the Gale Warning, southwest\nwinds 20 to 30 kt with gusts up to 35 kt and waves 6 to 9 feet\nexpected. For the Small Craft Advisory, southwest winds 15 to\n25 kt with gusts up to 30 kt and waves 2 to 5 feet expected.\n\n* WHERE...Seul Choix Point to Point Detour MI and 5NM East of a\nline from Fairport MI to Rock Island Passage.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, until 11 AM EST\nFriday. For the Gale Warning, from noon to 7 PM EST Friday.\nFor the Small Craft Advisory, until noon EST Friday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of stability.\nStrong winds will cause hazardous waves which could capsize or\ndamage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
