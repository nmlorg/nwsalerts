This amount\nof rain in a short amount of time will likely cause some\nflooding issues since storm drains may be blocked with snow.\nWithout a way to efficiently drain runoff off the roads some\nportions of streets may become impassible if significant ponding\nof water occurs. Small streams may experience significant rises\nas well, but mainstem river flooding is not expected. The\nheaviest rainfall is expected to occur between 8 PM and 2 AM\ntonight.",
