        "description": "...Periods of Heavy Rainfall This Evening and Overnight...\n\n.A storm system will bring a band of heavy rainfall to coastal\nareas of Humboldt and Del Norte counties this evening into the\nfirst half of the overnight. Additional showers are expected\nlater tonight into Thursday morning. With persistent light rain\nover the last week, creeks and streams are already elevated. This\nquick period of additional heavy rain will likely result in some\nsmall streams and creeks overtopping their banks on the coastal\nplain. Localized urban flooding will also be possible. Farther\ninland heavy snow is expected in the mountains resulting in a\nlower threat of flooding.\n\nThe Flood Watch continues for\n\n* A portion of northwest California, including the following\nareas, Coastal Del Norte and Northern Humboldt Coast.\n\n* Through Thursday morning.\n\n* One to two inches of rain is expected on top of saturated\nsoils. This will result in rising small streams and creeks\nwith some overtopping their banks. Localized urban flooding\nwill also be possible. Main stem river flooding is not\nexpected.\n\n* Some creeks and streams that may flood include Jacoby Creek,\nElk River, Freshwater Creek, Coffee Creek, Hookton Slough,\nMartin Slough, and other low lying areas. Some roads that may\nbe impacted in Humboldt County include Berta Road, Coffee\nCreek Road, Hookton Road, Howard Heights Road, Myrtle Avenue,\nOld Arcata Road, and Graham Road. Lake Earl Drive near the\nSmith River, Fred D Haight Drive, and other low lying areas\nmay see flooding in Del Norte County.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
