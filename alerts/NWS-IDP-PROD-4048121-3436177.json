Total accumulations of around an inch,\nwith locally higher amounts up to two inches.\n\n* WHERE...In South Carolina, locations north of Highway 11 in\nGreenville County, plus southern Oconee and southern Pickens\nCounties. In Georgia, Franklin County.\n\n* WHEN...From 6 AM this morning to 7 PM EST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Accumulating snow on area roadways, and occasionally\nreduced visibility, could make travel difficult at times.",
