        "description": "...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS EXPECTED...\n\n.A Blizzard Warning has been issued for portions of west central\nand southwest Minnesota starting 6 am Wednesday morning, and\ncontinues through the afternoon. A Winter Storm Watch with\nblizzard conditions possible surround the blizzard warning in\nwest central, southwest and south central Minnesota for the same\ntime period.\n\nConfidence has increased that portions of west central and\nsouthwest Minnesota, mainly west of a Morris to Redwood Falls to\nSt. James line, will have blizzard conditions developing behind a\nstrong Arctic front on Wednesday. The combination of strong gusty\nwinds and whiteout conditions will lead to blizzard conditions\nfor several hours. Confidence is lower on wind speeds farther to\nthe east and thus a Winter Storm Watch has been issued.\n\nIn addition to the blizzard conditions, temperatures will drop\noff sharply behind the Arctic front. Wind chill values will drop\nbelow -30 by the afternoon in west central Minnesota, with wind\nchills likely dropping below -35 by the evening. Outside the\nwarning and watch area, significant blowing and drifting snow is\nlikely, with locally one to two inches of snow by the afternoon.\nOther areas of Minnesota will have similar temperature dropping\nbehind the Arctic front, with wind chill values likely in the\n-10 to -20 range by the late afternoon in central, and southern\nMinnesota.\n\n* WHAT...Blizzard conditions possible. Total snow accumulations\nof up to one inch possible. Winds could gust as high as 35 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of central and south central Minnesota.\n\n* WHEN...From Wednesday morning through Wednesday afternoon.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Blowing snow could\nsignificantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions could\nimpact the evening commute.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The cold wind chills as low as 20 below\nzero could result in hypothermia if precautions are not taken.",
