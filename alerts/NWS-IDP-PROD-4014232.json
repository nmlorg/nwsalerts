        "description": "At 1222 PM EST, a snow squall was located along a line extending\nfrom Lava to Waymart to Meshoppen. Movement was southeast at 50 mph.\nThe squall likely will begin as rain in the lower elevations and\nchange to a burst of brief heavy snow 10 to 15 minutes after the\nonset. Road surface temperatures in northeast Pennsylvania and\nSullivan County New York were generally above freezing. The best\nchance for rapidly changing road conditions from wet to snowy and\nslippery will be over the higher terrain.\n\nWinds in excess of 40 mph are possible with this squall.\n\nThis squall will be near...\nBethel and Waymart around 1225 PM EST.\nHonesdale and Prompton around 1230 PM EST.\nShohola and Highland Lake around 1235 PM EST.\nDalton and Hawley around 1240 PM EST.\nScranton and Dunmore around 1245 PM EST.\n\nUse caution if you must travel into or through snow squalls. Rapid\nchanges in visibility and potentially slick roads are possible and\ncould lead to accidents.",
