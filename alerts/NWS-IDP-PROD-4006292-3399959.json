        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nBig Blue River...Driftwood River...East Fork White River...Eel\nRiver...Fall Creek...Flatrock River...Mill Creek...Mississinewa\nRiver...Sugar Creek...Tippecanoe River...Wabash River...White\nRiver...Wildcat Creek...Youngs Creek...\n\n\n.Minor to moderate flooding continues on many waterways in\ncentral and southern Indiana as of early Sunday evening.  This is a\nresult of up to about 4 inches of rain that fell between late\nThursday and late Saturday, heaviest in western Indiana near and\nsouth of Interstate 74.\n\nThe large majority of the Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers\nare either in flood or expected to flood, with some locations\nreaching moderate flood stage.  Crests are expected to be the highest\nsince either February or June of 2019.\n\nAs of early Sunday evening, the Wabash River was rising along the\nentire length of the river.  The crest is expected to reach Lafayette\nby Monday afternoon.  A broad crest on the White River is\nfrom Noblesville to Centerton.  The crest on the East Fork White\nRiver is in the Columbus and Seymour areas.  Flooding on the Wabash\nand and White Rivers will last into at least late next week.\nFlooding on the East Fork White River will last until probably late\nMonday or early Tuesday next week.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday, thus\narea waterways will be able to continue their downward trend.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River at Williams.\n* until Tuesday January 21.\n* At  7:00 AM Sunday the stage was 7.9 feet.\n* Flood stage is 8.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...Rise above flood stage by this afternoon and continue to\nrise to near 13.1 feet by Thursday evening.  It will fall below\nflood stage by Tuesday January 21.\n* At 13.2 feet...During the July 2015 summer flood, water began to\noverflow the road to the new Williams Bridge.  SR 450 closes in\nseveral locations. Most local roads in the flood plain are\nimpassable at this level.  Huron-Williams Road flooded south of\nPort Williams Road.  The summer flood crest of 13.2 feet came 3\nweeks later in the summer season than the June 28, 1960 crest of\n15.1 feet and is believed to be the latest for the summer season\nsince at least the late 1940s.",
