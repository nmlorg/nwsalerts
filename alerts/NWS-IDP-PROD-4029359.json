Lowest visibilities\nhave been and will continue for much of this morning in the upper\nJames Basin through the Turtle Mountains, where visibilities have\nranged from one mile to near zero at times.\n\nPedestrians walking and motorists driving should exercise caution\nthis morning. Fog will deposit a thin layer of ice as it comes in\ncontact with sidewalks and roadways. Not every roadway and\nsidewalk will experience this, but you may observe slippery\nconditions while walking or driving. Having a higher situational\nawareness of this possibility will allow for better control of\nyour vehicle and a safer commute. Please slow down and be aware of\nslippery sidewalks and roadways during your morning commute.\n\nAny slippery sidewalks or roadways should improve slowly this\nafternoon.",
