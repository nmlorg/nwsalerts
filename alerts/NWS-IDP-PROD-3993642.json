This band of snow showers will\nbriefly drop visibility to less than a half mile at times, and\nresult in slippery spots on untreated roads.\n\nWinds in excess of 30 mph are possible with this band of lake effect\nsnow, producing some blowing and drifting snow.\n\nThis includes the following highways...\nInterstate 390 near exit 12.\nInterstate 90 between exits 46 and 42.\n\nConditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be\nprepared for snow or ice covered roads, and greatly reduced\nvisibility. Slow down and allow extra time when traveling.",
