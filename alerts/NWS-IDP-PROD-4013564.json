This could cause\nfrost bite to unprotected skin in as little as 30 minutes. Over\neastern sections, temperatures will continue to fall rapidly\nthrough the morning commute with wind chills generally in the -10\nto -15 degree range. Conditions should improve as winds ease later\nthis morning into early afternoon.\n\nLight mixed precipitation that fell late Wednesday evening and\nmelted on roadways, will likely freeze rapidly on any untreated\nsurface. Be on the lookout for slippery spots during the morning\ncommute.",
