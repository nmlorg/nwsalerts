        "description": "Snow is going to move into the High Country of North Carolina,\nnorth into the Grayson Highlands this afternoon, as well as the\nfoothills of North Carolina. Look for 1 to 2 inches to accumulate\nfrom the Tennessee border in North Carolina to the Blue Ridge,\nmainly south of Jefferson and Sparta, with a dusting to an inch\nelsewhere. Locally higher amounts to 3 inches could occur at Beech\nMountain.\n\nTemperatures will struggle to reach above freezing this afternoon\nin the mountains, so any snow that falls will likely lead to slick\nspots on roadways. If traveling, reduce your speed and watch for\npoor visibility at times. The snow should be tapering off between\n5pm and 7pm.",
