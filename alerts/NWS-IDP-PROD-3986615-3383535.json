At levels above 11.5 feet, flooding likely\ncontinues along Central Road at the Eighteen Mile Creek crossing.\nThe water also remains very close to overtopping Pendleton Road\n(Highway 28) north of Pendleton. Minor fluctuations in the water\nlevel could permit some of the water to spill onto the roadway\nthere through the early morning hours.\n\n* Other locations that could experience flooding include low-lying\nand poor drainage areas around Pendleton, Central,  and Clemson.",
        "instruction": "Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the\ndangers of flooding. Do not attempt to travel across flooded roads.\nTurn around, don't drown.\n\nA Flood Advisory means river or stream flows are elevated, or ponding\nof water in urban or other areas is occurring or is imminent.",
