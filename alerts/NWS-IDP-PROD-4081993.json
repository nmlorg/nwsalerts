        "description": "An extended period of wet weather is forecast Monday through\nThursday with several rounds of heavy rain expected. Rain will\nbegin across west Alabama early Monday morning and spread quickly\neastward. Some of the rain may be heavy at times Monday and\nTuesday, but the coverage is not expected to be concentrated in\nany one area, so the flash flood potential is low both days. The\nrainfall early in the week will cause the soil to become\nsaturated, and produce a set-up for potential flooding issues\nWednesday and Wednesday night as heavier rainfall is forecast to\ndevelop. The highest rainfall totals through Thursday will be\nacross areas south of Interstate 20, where 4 to 6 inches are\nforecast. Along and north of Intestate 20, rainfall amounts are\nforecast to be between 3 and 4 inches. With many areas\nexperiencing well above normal rainfall for the month of February,\nany additional heavy rainfall could result in flash flooding and\nriver flooding.\n\nInterests across Central Alabama are urged to monitor the latest\nforecasts and be prepared to take protective actions if flooding\ndevelops.",
