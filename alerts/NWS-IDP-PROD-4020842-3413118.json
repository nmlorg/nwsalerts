        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nEast Fork White River...Wabash River...White River...\n\n\n.Minor to moderate flooding continued Sunday afternoon in central\nand southern Indiana on the major rivers.  Primary crests will\nbe/are comparable to those that occurred in February and June of\n2019.  Brief flooding on the Eel River that developed Saturday came\nto end early this afternoon.\n\nA mix of precipitation Friday and Saturday totaled as high as\napproximately 1.50 inches, which is slowing river falls in some\ncases and bringing lower secondary crests in other cases on the\nmajor rivers.  Flooding has returned to Seymour on the East Fork\nWhite River, and this afternoon it will return to Spencer on the\nWhite River.  The Driftwood River near Edinburgh will be near\nbankfull, with a crest near flood stage Sunday morning.\n\nFlooding along the lower portions of the White and Wabash Rivers\nwill continue until about Wednesday, January 29.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is forecast through midday Thursday.\nThis will give area waterways several days to drain and return to\nnear normal levels.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River at Petersburg.\n* until Monday January 27.\n* At 1:30 PM Sunday the stage was 24.5 feet.\n* Flood stage is 16.0 feet.\n* Moderate flooding is occurring and Moderate flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by Monday\nJanuary 27.\n* At 24.2 feet...During April 2013 when Petersburg reached this level,\nthe water only reached the white line of SR 257 south of\nWashington, but never closed the road.  Shoals only went to 11.67\nfeet during April 2013.  This is the first that locals can remember\nsuch a high stage for Petersburg and SR 257 remaining open.",
        "instruction": "Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...\n\nMotorists should never drive into flood water. Turn around and go\nanother way. Keep children away from flooded areas. Recreational and\nagricultural interests should remain alert to changing river\nconditions.\n\nFor detailed flood information go to weather.gov/ind on the web and\nclick on rivers and lakes.",
