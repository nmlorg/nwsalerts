        "description": "The arctic cold front was moving south across Marinette and Oconto\nCounties this evening. Light snow will taper off to scattered\nflurries by mid to late evening. Any additional snowfall\naccumulation should be around an inch or less. The combination\nof the falling snow, along with melting snow on pavement surfaces\nand falling air temperatures well below freezing could lead to a\nflash freeze this evening. Gusty northerly winds may also create\nsome areas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nOvernight, temperatures are expected to fall to 5 below to 5 above\nzero. The combination of the cold temperatures and gusty northerly\nwinds will produce wind chill readings in the 10 below to 20\nbelow zero range late tonight into Thursday morning. Wind chill\nreadings this low can produce frost bite in 30 minutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving this evening as\nroads will be slippery due to ice or snow. If venturing outdoors\novernight, wear layers of clothing along with a hat and gloves to\nprotect yourself from the cold.",
