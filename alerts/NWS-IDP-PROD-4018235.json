        "description": "Periods of light snow or snow flurries are possible from the\nNorthern Neck northeast into the Maryland eastern shore this\nmorning. Dry air at the surface will keep much of the precip aloft\nfrom making it to the surface but a few snow flakes may fall in\nareas where precip intensity is enough to overcome the dry air.\nImpacts to travel are expected to be minimal but drivers should be\naware of the potential for a few slick spots as ground\ntemperatures are near to slightly below freezing.",
