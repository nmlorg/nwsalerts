Winds gusting as high as 40 mph in the mountains. For\nthe Winter Weather Advisory below 5500 feet, snow expected to\ndevelop during the morning. Total snow accumulations of mostly 4\nto 8 inches, except only 1 to 3 inches in the Great Falls area.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of central, southwest and west central\nMontana.\n\n* WHEN...Until 11 AM MST Friday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult. Areas of blowing snow\ncould significantly reduce visibility over mountain passes. The\nhazardous conditions could impact the morning and evening\ncommutes. There will also be increased avalanche danger for\nbackcountry recreation.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snowfall will decrease somewhat this\nafternoon, possibly allowing it to partially melt on lower\nelevation roadways, then refreeze this evening. Snowfall will\nincrease again overnight, creating a greater icing hazard.",
