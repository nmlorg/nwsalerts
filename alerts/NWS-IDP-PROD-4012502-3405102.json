For the Freezing Spray Advisory,\nlight accumulation of freezing spray expected.\n\n* WHERE...Coastal Waters from Eastport, ME to Schoodic Point, ME\nout 25 NM, Coastal Waters from Schoodic Point, ME to\nStonington, ME out 25 NM and Intra Coastal Waters from\nSchoodic Point, ME to Stonington, ME.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, from 4 PM Thursday to 4 PM EST\nFriday. For the Freezing Spray Advisory, from 3 AM Friday to 9\nAM EST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in freezing spray is hazardous.\nFreezing spray may render mechanical and electronic components\ninoperative. Ice accretion on decks and superstructures may\nresult in some loss of stability. Strong winds will cause\nhazardous seas which could capsize or damage vessels and\nreduce visibility.",
