In addition to accumulating snow,\nbreezy and gusty winds could lead to blowing snow over mountain\npasses, which could significantly reduce visibilities.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow possible. Total snow accumulations 6 to 12\ninches between 4000 feet and 7000 feet, with 12 to 24 inches above\n7000 feet. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of central, southwest and west central Montana.\n\n* WHEN...From Wednesday afternoon through late Thursday night.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be difficult.
