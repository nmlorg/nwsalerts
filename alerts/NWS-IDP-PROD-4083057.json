        "description": ".Summary...\nA multi-day rainfall event is expected across the region starting\nTuesday and continuing into Thursday. This series of storm systems\nwill bring periods of moderate to heavy rain over an area that has\nalready experienced above normal rainfall through the winter months.\nWith many area rivers already running above normal, additional river\nflooding is expected in the days ahead.\n\n.Flood Potential and Concerns...\nWhile rainfall across the southern portion of our region has been\nnear to below normal over the last couple of months, rainfall\nfurther north, mainly along and north of a line from Dothan to\nAlbany has been much above normal. With the bulk of the heavy rain\nexpected across the northern half of our region, this sets the stage\nfor additional river flooding and some flash flooding.\n\nThere still is a little uncertainty with the track and timing of the\napproaching storm system, however the general consensus is that much\nof the area in Southeast Alabama and Southwestern Georgia could see\n2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated heavier totals near 6 inches.\nLighter totals are anticipated further south into the Florida\nPanhandle and Big Bend.\n\nBased on the latest rainfall forecast and current river conditions,\nthese rivers or creeks have the greatest potential to see additional\nriver flooding:\n\n1) Apalachicola River\n2) Chattahoochee River\n3) Flint River\n4) Kinchafoonee Creek\n5) Muckalee Creek\n6) Choctawhatchee River\n7) Pea River (at Ariton)\n8) Ochlockonee River (in Florida)\n\nIncreased releases from upstream on the Chattahoochee could also\nfurther increase the flood potential on the Chattahoochee and\nApalachicola Rivers into the weekend.\n\nFlash flooding is also a concern, but the risk for flash flooding\nwill occur on Wednesday and Thursday, mainly across Southeastern\nAlabama and Southwestern Georgia. Rainfall rates in Florida are not\nanticipated to be high enough to support flash flooding in this\nevent.\n\n.Preparedness Actions...\nShould the forecast continue to indicate an increased risk of\nflooding across the area later this week, a flood watch may be\nissued for a portion of our area on Tuesday.\n\nResidents living along area creeks and rivers should consider\nevaluating their flood threat, especially in locations with\nalready above normal river levels.\n\nFor an assessment of current and future hydrologic information in\nthe Tallahassee area of responsibility, visit our website at\nwww.weather.gov/tallahassee and click on the rivers and lakes\nlink.\n\nUsers of our hydrologic forecasts are reminded that these\npredictions only utilize the next 48 hours of rainfall, so river\nforecasts issued Tuesday morning will begin to include rainfall from\nmost of this upcoming event.
