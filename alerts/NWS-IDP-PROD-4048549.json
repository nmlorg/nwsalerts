        "description": "Periods of rain, heavy at times, is expected across the area on\nMonday through Thursday. The heaviest rainfall will likely fall\nacross southeast Tennessee and southwest North Carolina where 2 to\n4 inches are possible on Monday and Tuesday. Storm total rainfall\nfrom Monday through Thursday may range up to 4 to 6 inches across\nsoutheast Tennessee and southwest North Carolina. Storm total\nrainfall of 1 to 3 inches is expected across northeastern\nTennessee and southwest Virginia.\n\nAbove normal rainfall has occurred across the region during the\npast 14 days with rainfall totals during this period being 200 to\n300 percent above normal. For this reason, soils are saturated\nand river streamflows are much above normal, above the 90th\npercentile for streamflows across the region according to USGS\nstreamflow data. Therefore, any additional rainfall will likely\nlead to flooding concerns across the region, especially for\nsoutheast Tennessee and southwest North Carolina.\n\nThere is still some uncertainty on the timing of periods of\nheaviest rainfall and exact amounts over the next couple of days.\nWe will continue to monitor this situation and will issue more\ninformation as the system approaches.\n\nStay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio and other local media for\nfurther details, updates, and potential watches and warnings that\nmay be issued.",
