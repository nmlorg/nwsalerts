        "description": "* WHAT...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, heavy freezing\nspray at a rate of 2 cm per hour or greater expected, and may\nrapidly accumulate on vessels. For the Gale Warning, north winds up\nto 35 kt and waves 7 to 10 feet expected.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of Lake Michigan.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, from midnight\ntonight to noon CST Thursday. For the Gale Warning, from 9 PM\nthis evening to 9 AM CST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
