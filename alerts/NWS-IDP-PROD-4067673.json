Whatever falls here is likely to be\nsnow, or a mix of snow and rain. Temperatures will only be\nmarginally cold enough for snow to accumulate. The most likely\nlocation for accumulations is at elevations above about 2000 feet,\nwhere an inch or two will be possible. This could affect travel\non Thursday, especially on roads crossing the taller ridges.",
