Please see the specific\nimpacts listed for your location of interest below or by going to\nthe web page described below.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River at Elliston.\n* until Tuesday February 18.\n* At  8:00 AM Tuesday the stage was 19.5 feet.\n* Flood stage is 18.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will rise to near 22.4 feet by Wednesday evening then\nbegin falling.
