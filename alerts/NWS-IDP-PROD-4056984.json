        "description": "Light snow will taper off to scattered flurries by late evening.\nAny additional snowfall accumulation should be less than an inch.\nThe combination of the falling snow, along with melting snow\non pavement surfaces earlier this evening and falling air\ntemperatures well below freezing could lead to icy roads. Gusty\nnortherly winds may also create some areas of blowing and drifting\nsnow.\n\nOvernight, temperatures are expected to fall to 5 below to 5 above\nzero. The combination of the cold temperatures and gusty northerly\nwinds will produce wind chill readings in the 10 below to 20\nbelow zero range late tonight into Thursday morning. Wind chill\nreadings this low can produce frost bite in 30 minutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving tonight as roads\nwill be slippery due to ice or snow. If venturing outdoors\novernight, wear layers of clothing along with a hat and gloves\nto protect yourself from the cold.",
