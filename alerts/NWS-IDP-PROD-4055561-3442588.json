        "description": "...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS EXPECTED IN WESTERN MINNESOTA TODAY... ...\nDANGEROUS WIND CHILLS EXPECTED THIS EVENING THROUGH THURSDAY\nMORNING...\n\n.A Blizzard Warning remains in effect for portions of west\ncentral and southwest Minnesota starting this morning, and\ncontinuing through the afternoon. A Winter Weather Advisory\ncontinues east of the Blizzard Warning for blowing snow and\npossible near- blizzard conditions at times, as well as the\npotential for flash freezing roadways and surfaces as temperatures\nplummet this afternoon behind an Arctic front. Wind Chill\nWarnings remain in effect for west central through southwestern\nMinnesota, and have been extended farther east into central and\nsouth-central Minnesota. Wind Chill Advisories remain in place for\neast central Minnesota, southeast Minnesota and west- central\nWisconsin Wednesday night into Thursday morning.\n\nConfidence remains high based on upstream observations that\nblizzard conditions will develop this morning and afternoon\nacross portions of west central and southwest Minnesota, mainly\nwest of a Morris to Redwood Falls to St. James line. East of the\nblizzard warning, winds will be lighter and visibilities are not\nexpected to drop to blizzard criteria, but areas of blowing snow\nand periods of near- blizzard conditions remain possible during a\nfew hours of light snow later this morning and afternoon.\nPlummeting temperatures this afternoon and evening may lead to\nflash freezing of this light snow on roadways and surfaces, with\nimpacts to the evening commute expected.\n\nIn addition to the blizzard conditions, temperatures will drop\noff sharply behind the Arctic front. Wind chill values will drop\nto 25 to 30 degrees below zero by this afternoon in west central\nMinnesota, with wind chills of 35 to 40 degrees below zero likely\nby the evening. These dangerous wind chills will continue into\nmid- morning Thursday. In eastern Minnesota into western\nWisconsin, wind chills will drop to between 25 and 35 degrees\nbelow zero late Wednesday night through Thursday morning.\n\n* WHAT...For the Blizzard Warning, blizzard conditions expected.\nTotal snow accumulations of up to one inch. Winds gusting as\nhigh as 40 mph. For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold\nwind chills expected. Wind chills as low as 45 below zero.\n\n* WHERE...Stevens County.\n\n* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Warning, from 6 PM this evening to\n10 AM CST Thursday. For the Blizzard Warning, until 6 PM CST\nthis evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Areas of blowing\nsnow could significantly reduce visibility. The hazardous\nconditions could impact the morning or evening commute. The\ndangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed\nskin in as little as 10 minutes.",
