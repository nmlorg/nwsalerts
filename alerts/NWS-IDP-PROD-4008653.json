With temperatures hovering near to just below freezing,\nthis may produce a thin glaze of ice on untreated roads and paved\nsurfaces, especially over areas north of Highway 30. Ice may also\nquickly accumulate on car wind shields.\n\nMotorists should be prepared for rapidly changing driving\nconditions due to accumulating snow and ice late this evening.\nSlow down, allow extra travel time and be extra cautious on\nbridges and overpasses.",
