        "description": "A dynamic weather system will likely produce a light wintry mix\nover portions of southeast Missouri and southern Illinois tonight\ninto early Thursday morning.\n\nTemperatures tonight will be close to the freezing mark as the\nprecipitation moves in from west to east.\n\nAt this time, any accumulations of snow, sleet, or freezing rain\nare expected to be extremely isolated and should not pose a\nsignificant travel concern. Regardless, drivers should still be\nwatchful for any slick spots on elevated road surfaces, such as\nbridges, late tonight.\n\nThe best chance for seeing any wintry mix at all will be along and\nwest of the Mississippi River in southeast Missouri, and in\nsouthern Illinois, along and west of Interstate 57.\n\nTemperatures are expected to warm overnight, so any wintry mix\nshould turn back to rain quickly Thursday morning, limiting any\nfurther travel concerns.",
