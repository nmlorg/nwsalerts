Due to already\nsaturated grounds, much of this rain quickly became runoff,\nfilling ditches, small creeks and streams, and other tributaries\nthat feed into Indian Creek. The creek is expected to rise above\nFlood Stage of 7.5 feet later this morning, and will crest and\nthen fall back below Flood Stage late this afternoon. Minor\nflooding will occur along the Indian Creek Greenway during this\ntime, so please use caution from Providence southward to\nInterstate 565.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nNorthwestern Huntsville, Madison, Redstone Arsenal, Triana,\nMarshall Space Flight Center and Harvest.",
