In New Hampshire, Coastal Rockingham, Interior\nRockingham, and Strafford.\n\n* From this evening through late tonight\n\n* A period of heavy rain is expected overnight with one to one and\na half inches of rain possible in just 3 to 6 hours. This amount\nof rain in a short amount of time will likely cause some\nflooding issues since storm drains may be blocked with snow. In\naddition, snowbanks on the side of roads may not allow the\nrainfall to drain off fast enough before flooding occurs.\nTherefore, it is possible that some streets may become\nimpassible as ponding of water occurs. Small streams may\nexperience significant rises as well. The heaviest rainfall is\nexpected to occur between 8 PM and 1 AM tonight.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
