        "description": "A low pressure system moving rapidly across the region today will\ninteract with the chilly airmass in place to produce light snow\nat times. Accumulations will be possible by the afternoon, with a\nhalf inch of snow in the mountain valleys to nearly 2 inches\nalong the higher mountain ridges, and a dusting to a half inch in\nseveral locations across Upstate South Carolina, northeast\nGeorgia, and the North Carolina foothills. Accumulations would\nmainly affect grassy and elevated surfaces, but light\naccumulations are possible on colder road surfaces such as\nbridges and overpasses.\n\nMost locations will see temperatures climb above freezing today,\nbut likely stay locked in the 30s. Significant travel impacts are\nnot expected, but a few locations could see temperatures hover\nnear the freezing mark for a good part of the day. A few slippery\nspots could develop on area roadways, especially in the central\nand northern mountains, and across the western North Carolina\nfoothills.",
