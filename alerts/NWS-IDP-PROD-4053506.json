Currently, the front has made it through our\nnorthwestern area leaving drizzle in its wake, and calm winds and\nhigh moisture ahead of the front are allowing for fog to develop,\nespecially along the coastal areas. Motorists should exercise\ncaution while on the roads due to lower visibilities and perhaps\nslick road surfaces.",
