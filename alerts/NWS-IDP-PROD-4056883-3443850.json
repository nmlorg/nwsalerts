        "description": "...SNOW AND WIND ALONG WITH MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES OVERNIGHT...\n\n.An arctic cold front continues to push southward across the area\nthis evening, bringing light snow and wind along with much colder\ntemperatures. 1 to 3 inches of snow is expected across east-\ncentral Wisconsin. Less than an inch of additional accumulation is\nexpected across the north, except locally higher amounts across\nthe snowbelt region of northwest Vilas County.\n\nGusty northerly winds of 15 to 25 mph, except 20 to 30 mph with\ngusts around 35 mph across the Fox Valley east to the lakeshore\nwill create areas of blowing and drifting snow into early Thursday\nmorning. Temperatures falling well below freezing may lead to a\nflash freeze, leading to the potential for black ice.\n\nThe combination of cold temperatures and winds will result in\nwind chills as low as 20 below to 25 below zero over north\ncentral and parts of central Wisconsin late tonight into Thursday\nmorning.\n\nMotorists should anticipate hazardous travel conditions tonight,\nespecially in the Fox Valley and lakeshore areas. Anyone planning\noutdoor activities should dress in layers and cover exposed skin\nto avoid the risk of frostbite.\n\n* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches.\nWinds gusting to around 35 mph, causing areas of blowing and\ndrifting snow. Rapidly falling temperatures may cause wet roads\nto flash freeze, leading to areas of black ice.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of east central and northeast Wisconsin.\n\n* WHEN...From 6 PM this evening to 6 AM CST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on hazardous travel conditions, with snow or ice\ncovered roads. Areas of blowing snow could significantly reduce\nvisibility in open areas, especially on west to east oriented\nroads.",
