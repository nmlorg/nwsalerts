        "description": "Rises continue to be observed on the Missouri River in the Hoge\nIsland area. With high temperatures reaching the upper 30s this\nWednesday afternoon, ice will likely start to erode in the Square\nButte Creek, Ponderosa and Hoge Island areas over the next 12 to\n24 hours. This will cause an eventual decrease in water levels.\n\nThose with interests along the Missouri River should continue to\npay close attention to river conditions, as cycles of ice formation\nand ice loss will continue to cause fluctuating water levels over\nthe coming days.",
