        "description": "A developing low pressure will rapidly intensify as it lifts out\nof the north Pacific on Tuesday. This very powerful weather\nsystem will move into the Gulf of Alaska by Tuesday night and then\nmove inland over the Kenai Peninsula by Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAs the associated weather front moves over the Gulf of Alaska\nTuesday, east winds will increase to storm force over the eastern\nside of the gulf and spread into the northern gulf through\nTuesday night. Gale force southwest winds will persist into\nWednesday behind the front. Wave heights will build as the low\nmoves north and range from 25 to 35 feet by Wednesday morning.\nMarine travel will be very hazardous over the Gulf of Alaska\nthrough this event.\n\nWinds over the coastal land areas will increase Tuesday night with\ngusts near 50 mph or higher. Other areas over the inner channels\nwill also see gusty winds through Tuesday night and Wednesday with\ngusts from 40 to 50 mph. Be sure to secure loose objects prior to\nTuesday night. Also be prepared for power outages, travel delays\nand other impacts from this event.",
