Heavy freezing spray at a rate of 2 cm\nper hour or greater expected, and may rapidly accumulate on\nvessels.\n\n* WHERE...Saxon Harbor WI to Black River MI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, from 7 AM EST /6 AM CST/ Tuesday\nto 4 AM EST /3 AM CST/ Wednesday. For the Heavy Freezing Spray\nWarning, from 10 AM EST /9 AM CST/ Tuesday to 7 AM EST /6 AM\nCST/ Wednesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of stability.\nStrong winds will cause hazardous waves which could capsize or\ndamage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
