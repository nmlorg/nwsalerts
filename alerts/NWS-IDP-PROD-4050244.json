        "description": "Moderate snow will spread into areas from Celina to Kenton late\nthis afternoon and continue into early evening before changing to\nrain. Some locally heavy bursts of snow will be possible, with\nvisibility falling below a mile. Accumulations will mainly be\nlimited to grassy and elevated surfaces, and could range from 1 to\n2 inches before the changeover occurs early this evening. The\ngreatest chance of the higher accumulations will be along and\nnorth of a Celina to Kenton line. Here, an isolated 3 inch amount\nis possible.\n\nRoads should remain just wet through the afternoon, but with the\nonset of darkness, some slippery spots may develop across the area\nand linger for an hour or two even after the snow changes to rain.\nUse caution of traveling across the area later this afternoon\nand through the early evening.",
