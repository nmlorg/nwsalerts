        "description": "A wintry mix from snow, sleet, to light freezing rain will be\npossible over portions of east central Minnesota into northwest\nWisconsin. Radar showed most of the wintry mix was occurring along\nand just west of the Interstate 35 corridor including the\nHinckley, Finlayson, Willow River, McGrath, and Moose Lake areas.\nThe precipitation will not be particularly heavy but even a\nlittle freezing rain and sleet could quickly coat roadways with a\nthin layer of ice that may be undetectable. Please use extreme\ncaution... especially on bridges...overpasses and around curves.\nAllow plenty of stopping distance and avoid braking suddenly.",
