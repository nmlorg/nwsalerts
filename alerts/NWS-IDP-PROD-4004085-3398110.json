Two to four inches of rain have fallen since  11 AM\nthis morning.\n\nThe Little River gauge at Merrill Lane near Penrose was near 10 feet\nand still rising. At this stage, minor flooding will occur over\nCascade Lake Road north of Merrill Lane at Crab Creek, with up to a\nfoot of water over the road. Several gauges across Transylvania and\nHenderson counties are over Action Stage, with minor flooding\npossible along Mud Creek, Davidson River and other tributaries of\nthe Upper French Broad Valley.",
        "instruction": "Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Do not attempt to cross\nwater-covered roadways, bridges, or low-level crossings. Only a few\ninches of rapidly flowing water can carry away your vehicle. It is\nnot worth the risk. Please TURN AROUND, DON'T DROWN.\n\nBe especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the\ndangers of flooding.\n\nOnly when it is safe to do so, please report floodwaters or\nlandslides flowing over roads or threatening property to the National\nWeather Service by calling toll-free, 1, 800, 2 6 7, 8 1 0 1, by\nposting on our Facebook page, or via Twitter using hashtag NWSGSP.\nYour message should describe the event and the specific location\nwhere it occurred, including roadways, nearby cross streets, stream\nnames and other landmarks.",
