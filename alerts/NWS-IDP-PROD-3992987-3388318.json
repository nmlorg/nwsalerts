        "description": "* WHAT...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, heavy freezing\nspray at a rate of 2 cm per hour or greater occurring, and may\nrapidly accumulate on vessels. For the Gale Warning, northwest\nwinds 20 to 25 kt with gusts up to 35 kt and waves 6 to 11\nfeet occurring. For the Small Craft Advisory, northwest winds\n15 to 25 kt with gusts up to 35 kt and waves 6 to 11 feet\nexpected. For the Gale Watch, south winds 20 to 30 kt with\ngusts up to 40 kt and waves 3 to 6 feet possible.\n\n* WHERE...Huron Islands to Marquette MI, Marquette to Munising\nMI and Munising to Grand Marais MI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, until 10 AM EST\nthis morning. For the Gale Warning, until 7 AM EST this\nmorning. For the Small Craft Advisory, until 7 PM EST this\nevening. For the Gale Watch, from late tonight through\nThursday evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
