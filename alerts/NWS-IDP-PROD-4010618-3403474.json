Flooding has ended on most\nor all creeks and smaller rivers.  Flooding is the result of up to\nabout 4 inches of rain that fell late last week.\n\nCrests will be/are comparable to those that occurred in February\nand June of 2019.\n\nThe Wabash River is either cresting or slightly past crest from\nCovington to Terre Haute.  The crest will reach Hutsonville\nmid-day Thursday.  The White River crest is between Elliston and\nNewberry.  The crest along the East Fork White River is nearing\nnearing Rivervale where it should top out at about 28.9 feet\nmid-day Wednesday.  Flooding along the lower portions of the White\nand Wabash River is likely to continue until the weekend of\nJanuary 25.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday,\nwhich will allow drainage to continue out of area rivers this week.\nAbove normal precipitation is possible this coming Friday through\nSaturday, which could exacerbate elevated water levels and lead to\nrenewed flooding on area waterways.  Precipitation is expected to\nstart off as snow then transition to rain late Friday into Friday\nnight.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River at Shoals.\n* until late Sunday night.\n* At  8:30 PM Tuesday the stage was 18.8 feet.\n* Flood stage is 20.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...Rise above flood stage by late tonight and continue to\nrise to near 22.8 feet by Friday afternoon.  It will fall below\nflood stage by Sunday afternoon.\n* At 22.5 feet...West River Road east from Shoals flooded in at least\ntwo locations.  Residential area near McBrides Bluff isolated by\nhigh water.  Low lying county roads east of McBrides Bluff also\nflooded.",
