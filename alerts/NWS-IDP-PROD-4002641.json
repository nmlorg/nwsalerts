        "description": "A series of 3 storms is expected to bring snow over the mountains\nand into the foothills next week. The strongest storm will be\nWednesday night into early Friday.\n\nSnow is expected to start falling over the mountains of Shasta\nCounty by Sunday morning, reaching the West Slope of the northern\nSierra Nevada by afternoon. The heaviest snowfall is expected\nSunday night. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches, with\nlocalized amounts up to 8 inches over peaks, are forecast. Plan\non slippery road conditions and possible chain controls.\n\nThe next storm system arrives Monday night and continues into\nTuesday. The heaviest snowfall is expected Monday night. Total\nsnow accumulations of 6 to 12 inches are forecast. Plan on\nslippery road conditions and likely chain controls and delays.\n\nThe third and strongest of the series of storms arrives Wednesday\nnight and continues into early Friday. Early estimates suggest 2\nto 3 feet of snow at pass levels, locally more over peaks. This\ncold storm should have snow levels around 1,000-2000 feet,\nlocally lower possible. This will bring winter driving conditions\ninto the foothills, potentially down into the far northern\nSacramento Valley.\n\nPeriods of snow may cause travel difficulties. Be prepared for\nsnow covered roads and limited visibilities, and use caution while\ndriving. The latest road conditions for the state you are calling\nfrom can be obtained by calling 5 1 1.",
