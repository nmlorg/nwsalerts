        "description": "Doppler radar indicated freezing drizzle was developing across\nportions of west-central Illinois. The freezing drizzle was\nexpanding into Knox county, and may eventually reach Stark and\nMarshall counties. The potential for freezing drizzle will\ncontinue through 6 or 7 am, after which temperatures are expected\nto climb above freezing.\n\nWith temperatures currently hovering around freezing, the\nfreezing drizzle may create a glaze of ice on untreated roads and\nsidewalks. Hazardous travel may develop for the morning commute,\nespecially on bridges and overpasses.\n\nTemperatures warming even before sunrise should limit the\nduration of any icy conditions, but remain alert for slippery\nroads early this morning.",
