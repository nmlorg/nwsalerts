Wind and waves will subside later this morning as high\npressure moves into the region.\n\n* WHAT...West winds 15 to 20 knots with gusts up to 25 knots and\nwaves up to 3 feet.\n\n* WHERE...Oak Point to Saxon Harbor WI.\n\n* WHEN...Until 9 AM CST this morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Conditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
