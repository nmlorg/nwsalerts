Cold and dry air in place across the\nregion ahead of this system will support snowfall as the\nprecipitation develops from the west-southwest through the later\nmorning hours. The highest snow accumulations will likely occur\nnear the junction of the Georgia, North Carolina, and South\nCarolina borders in the extreme southern Appalachians.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 1 to 3\ninches, with local 4 inch amounts near the North Carolina\nborder.\n\n* WHERE...Rabun and Habersham Counties in extreme northeast\nGeorgia.\n\n* WHEN...From 6 AM this morning to 7 PM EST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Accumulating snow on area roadways, and reduced\nvisibility in snow, could make travel very difficult.",
