While the snow may start light, the rate will increase with\nperiods of moderate to heavy snow, which will cause the visibility\nto drop under a half a mile at times. Winds from the southeast\ngusting between 30 and 40 mph will also aid in lowered visibility.\nSnow reports so far range from between 1 and 3 inches over\nsoutheast Iowa with additional snow accumulations expected across\nthe state.\n\nThrough this afternoon, snow rates will decrease with a transition\nto freezing drizzle with minor ice accumulations expected. Then,\nstrong winds from the northwest gusting over 45 mph will develop\nearly Saturday along with falling temperatures, which should\nresult in a flash freeze on roadways. The gusty winds will also\ncreate widespread blowing snow with visibility under one-quarter\nof a mile at times over parts of northern Iowa.\n\n* WHAT...Periods of moderate to heavy snow will transition to\nmixed precipitation this afternoon into overnight. Additional\nsnow accumulations of 1 to 3 inches and ice accumulations of\naround one tenth of an inch. Winds gusting as high as 45 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Southern Iowa.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.
