        "description": "Snow will develop across the area during the mid-day hours, then\ndiminish by early evening. The snow in central and east-central\nWisconsin could transition to freezing drizzle as it tapers off\nlate today and this evening. An inch or two of snow accumulation\nis expected across most of the area, with 2 to 3 inches possible\nin far north-central Wisconsin.\n\nThe snow is likely to result in slippery travel conditions.\nAlthough the morning commute will not be affected, the afternoon\ncommute is likely to be slowed by the snow. Be sure to allow for\nsome extra travel time once the snow begins\n\nMuch colder air will surge into the area overnight as the weather\nsystem producing the snow shifts off to the east. By daybreak\nThursday, temperatures will drop to around zero across central\nand north-central Wisconsin, and into the teens along the\nLakeshore. This will drive wind chill indices into the 10 below to\n20 below zero range across most of the area, and to 5 below to 10\nbelow along the Lakeshore. Wind chills such as this indicate\nexposed skin can suffer frostbite in as little as 30 minutes. Be\nsure to dress accordingly before heading out on Thursday morning.\n\nThe gusty winds ushering the colder air into the area could\nalso produce some drifting snow tonight, mainly in rural areas.\nOf greater significance is the potential for the rapid arrival of\nthe colder air to cause any lingering water on the roads to re-\nfreeze into glare ice and produce very slippery conditions. Be\nprepared for the possibility of icy spots on roads and sidewalks\ntomorrow morning.",
