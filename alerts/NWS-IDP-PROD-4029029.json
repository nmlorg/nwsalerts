This will especially be the case for\nuntreated secondary roads and on elevated surfaces such as bridges\nand overpasses. Cars and grassy surfaces could experience\naccumulations of up to two inches as this large area of snow moves\nthrough. Motorists should allow a little extra time to reach\ntheir destination this evening. Temperatures in the region will\ngenerally be in the mid 30s.",
