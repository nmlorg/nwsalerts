        "description": "Rainfall is expected over portions of the Mississippi\nValley, Midwest, and Great Lakes Regions beginning today and\ncontinuing into the weekend. A Flood Watch is effect for areas\nexpected to receive the heaviest rainfall, generally along and\nsoutheast of I-55. Although the Rock and Fox River Basins are not\nexpected to receive heavy liquid precipitation at this time, very\nwet antecedent conditions mean that the area remains vulnerable to\nrainfall. A relatively small change to the track of the upcoming\nweather system could change the amount of precipitation that falls\nas rain rather than snow or ice. If more rainfall occurs than\ncurrently forecasted, large rises on waterways in the Rock and Fox\nBasins could occur.\n\nThis outlook means that elevated water levels and potential\nimpacts are possible. Persons should closely monitor the latest\nforecasts.",
