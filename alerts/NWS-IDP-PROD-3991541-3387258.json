An\nadditional 1.5 to 2.5 inches of rain is expected to fall across\nthe Willapa Hills today. A 2-4 hour window of heavier rain this\nafternoon could push some area rivers above flood stage. The\nNaselle River, and particularly the Willapa River, will be the\nmost susceptible to reaching minor flood stage.\n\n* If minor flood stage is reached along the Willapa River, Heckard\nRoad will become inundated. Portions of US 101 may also become\ninundated in the evening as high tide approaches.\n\n* If minor flood stage is reached along the Naselle River,\nhistorically, water surrounds some homes along the river, and a\nfew low lying sections of Washington State Route 4 will become\ninundated.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.\n\nLandslides and debris flows are possible during this flood event.\nPeople, structures and roads located below steep slopes, in\ncanyons and near the mouths of canyons may be at serious risk\nfrom rapidly moving landslides.",
