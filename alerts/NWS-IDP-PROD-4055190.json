        "description": "A round of snow followed by windy and much colder weather is\nanticipated during the next 36 hours as an arctic cold front\nsurges south across the area. Snow will accompany the front, then\na short-lived but fairly intense shot of cold air will follow in\nthe wake of the snow.\n\nSnow associated with the front will develop across north-central\nWisconsin mid-day today. The snow will expand south and east\nduring the afternoon, reaching central and east-central Wisconsin\nduring the late afternoon or early evening hours. Milder air will\nflow into the area ahead of the front, possibly warming\ntemperatures enough to cause some rain to briefly mix with the\nsnow at the onset over central and east-central Wisconsin. The\nsnow over north-central Wisconsin will taper off during the\nevening, though snow showers off Lake Superior will continue to\naffect the snowbelt. The snow over east-central Wisconsin will\ncontinue until around midnight before diminishing. A widespread 1\nto 3 inch snowfall is anticipated across the area.\n\nNorth winds will increase and become gusty as the colder air pours\ninto the area overnight. This will cause some blowing and\ndrifting of the snow, especially in east-central Wisconsin.\nTemperatures will also fall sharply. By daybreak Thursday, the\ncombination of wind and cold temperatures will result in wind\nchill indices ranging from around 20 below zero in north-central\nWisconsin to around 5 below along the lakeshore. Wind chills\naround 20 below zero indicate exposed skin can suffer frostbite in\nas little as 30 minutes.\n\nAdditional snow accumulations after midnight will be minor and\nprobably limited to the Lake Superior snowbelt and possibly some\nareas near Lake Michigan. However, the cold temperatures and\nblowing and drifting snow will probably hinder the efforts of\nhighway crews to treat the roads, and result in hazardous travel\nconditions lingering through the Thursday morning commute. Flight\ndelays are also possible at area airports.\n\nBe sure to plan on needing some some extra travel time if you will\nbe driving somewhere at any point later today through tomorrow\nmorning. Plan on encountering slippery roads and use extra\ncaution. Also plan on needing to wear warm winter clothing\nThursday due to the combination of wind and cold.",
