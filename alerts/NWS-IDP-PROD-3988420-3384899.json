A longshore current flows\nparallel to the beach and can be strong enough to knock you off\nthe sandbar into deep water.\n\n* WHERE...Southern Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie, Martin,\nCoastal Volusia and Northern Brevard Counties.\n\n* WHEN...From 7 AM EST this morning through this afternoon.\n\n* IMPACTS...The rough surf can knock you down and make you more\nsusceptible to being caught in the seaward pull of a Rip\nCurrent. Rip currents are also likely near piers, jetties and\nreefs today. If you must enter the chilly surf only do so near\na lifeguard and never swim alone.",
        "instruction": "Swim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and\nfloat. Don't swim against the current. If able, swim in a\ndirection following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the\nshore and call or wave for help.",
