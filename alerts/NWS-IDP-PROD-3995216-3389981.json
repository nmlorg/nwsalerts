The next system and cold\nfront Friday will bring 1 to 2 inches of precipitation. The snow\nlevel will start off low at about 1000 feet but will rise to over\n3000 feet as the precipitation comes in. With the Skokomish River\nnot far below flood stage by that time, there is a good chance the\nstorm will be enough to drive the Skokomish back up above flood\nstage Friday night.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Chehalis River At Porter\n* Until Friday evening.\n* At  8:45 AM Thursday the stage was 48.9 feet.\n* Flood stage is 48.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...The river is cresting now at around 49.0 feet at 7 AM\nThursday and will continue to fall to below flood stage Friday\nearly afternoon.\n* Impact...At 48.0 feet, the Chehalis River in Grays Harbor will flood\nlow pasture lands and some roads. High tidal levels at Aberdeen\nwill worsen flooding along the lower reaches.",
