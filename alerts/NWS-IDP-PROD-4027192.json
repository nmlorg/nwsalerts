        "description": "At 246 AM EST, Doppler radar was tracking a line of showers and\ndeveloping thunderstorm stretching from near Rocky Mount south\nacross Edgecombe, Wilson and Wayne Counties. Theses storms are\nmoving northeast at 55 mph. Very heavy rain and wind gusts up to 40\nmph are possible with these storms.\n\nThe strongest thunderstorms were intensifying and located just east\nGoldsboro, Eureka and Saratoga.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nRocky Mount, Goldsboro, Roanoke Rapids, Tarboro, Halifax, Wilson,\nMount Olive, Scotland Neck, Elm City and Fremont.",
        "instruction": "Seek shelter in a nearby building or vehicle. Wind gusts as high as\n40 mph are capable of knocking down tree limbs and blowing around\ntrash cans, potted plants, lawn furniture and other light outdoor\nobjects.\n\nLocally heavy rain will quickly reduce visibility and result in\nponding of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and\nminor flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.\nDrivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid\nhydroplaning, especially in urban areas where prolonged heavy rain\ncan quickly lead to flooding.",
