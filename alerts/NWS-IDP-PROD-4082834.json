At the same\ntime, we are seeing light rain showers move through the North\nCountry. This will allow for some pockets of freezing rain in\nlocations where temperatures remain below freezing. It could take\nseveral more hours for the warmer air to displace the colder air\nwhich could create some slippery roadways and sidewalks until\ntemperatures warm above freezing this afternoon. If you are out\ncommuting across northern New York or eastern Vermont, prepare for\nquickly changing road conditions.",
