        "description": "A wintry mix of rain, freezing rain and sleet was causing\nuntreated roads, on and off ramps, bridges and overpasses to\nbecome slippery. Even though air temperatures have risen above\nfreezing in most locations, road temperatures remain cold enough\nto cause rain to freeze on contact.\n\nThe worst of the conditions should occur between 11 am and 1 pm,\nwith improving conditions during the afternoon. Air and road\ntemperatures will continue to rise into the afternoon, and highway\ndepartments will be salting slick roads in some areas.",
