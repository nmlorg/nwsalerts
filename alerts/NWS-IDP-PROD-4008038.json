Although precipitation is\nvery light, temperatures near or just below freezing will allow\nthis light precipitation to freeze on contact with the ground.\nThis will result in any untreated surfaces to become slippery with\na thin coating of ice.\n\nIf traveling or walking through the early evening hours, keep in\nmind that icy conditions are possible across the area. Use caution\nand allow extra time to reach your destination.",
