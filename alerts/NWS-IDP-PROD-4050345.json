        "description": "Colder temperatures with a chance of wintry precipitation will\nspread across the South Plains Monday behind a strong surface cold\nfront. An upper level storm system will quickly follow behind the\ncold front from the west on Tuesday and Wednesday, bringing even\ncolder air and the potential for more winter weather including ice\nand accumulating snow across the region.\n\nThe first round will see precipitation chances increase sharply\nearly Monday, with freezing rain possible on the Caprock, as\ntemperatures hover around the freezing point during the morning\nhours. A few slick spots will be possible especially on elevated\nsurfaces. Across the Rolling Plains primarily rain is expected\nduring the day on Monday. The second round of precipitation\nTuesday into Wednesday will be more intense and widespread. Snow\ntotals of several inches or more will be possible over the extreme\nsouthwest Texas Panhandle and northwestern South Plains by early\nWednesday morning and a winter storm watch is currently in effect.\nFreezing rain and lighter snow totals, are possible for the rest\nof the South Plains and Rolling Plains by Wednesday morning.\nDriving conditions may be hazardous for much of the area beginning\nTuesday morning and extending through Wednesday afternoon.",
