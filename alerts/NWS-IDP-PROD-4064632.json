Visibilities in the\ndense fog were being reduced to one quarter mile or less, which\nmay impact the evening commute in some locations. Motorists should\nremain alert for rapid changes in visibility over short distances.\nIf you encounter fog, please slow down, keep your headlights on\nlow beam and give yourself plenty of distance between other\nvehicles. The dense fog may continue to expand into this evening,\nas winds go light ahead of an approaching low pressure system.\nIf this occurs, a Dense Fog Advisory may be needed.",
