For the High\nRip Current Risk, dangerous rip currents expected. For the\nCoastal Flood Advisory, salt-water intrusion over local roads\nand low- lying areas near beaches causing minor flooding,\nparticularly at high tide.\n\n* WHERE...Culebra, St. Thomas, St. John, and Adjacent Islands.\n\n* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 6 PM AST Monday. For\nthe High Rip Current Risk, through late Monday night. For the\nCoastal Flood Advisory, until 6 PM AST Sunday. The next high\ntide for St. Thomas is between 3-5 AM Sunday, and 5-7 AM Sunday in\nCulebra.\n\n* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and\nlocalized beach erosion. High surf will wash over nearby rocks\nand jetties. Rip currents can sweep even the best swimmers away\nfrom shore into deeper water. During high tide, coastal\nflooding is possible with water potentially covering streets and\nlow- lying areas.",

Take the necessary actions to\nprotect flood-prone property.\n\nInexperienced swimmers should remain out of the water due to\ndangerous surf conditions.\n\nSwim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and\nfloat. Don't swim against the current. If able, swim in a\ndirection following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the\nshore and call or wave for help.",
