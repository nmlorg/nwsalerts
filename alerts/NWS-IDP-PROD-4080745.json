        "description": "Melting of recent snowfall due to sunshine and traffic will\ncreate patchy areas of black ice on roadways this evening and\novernight across the western mountains of North Carolina,\nsouthwest Virginia, and southeast West Virginia where 1 to 3\ninches of snow was common earlier today, with isolated snow totals\nin excess of 5 inches across southeast West Virginia.\n\nTemperatures are already below freezing above 3500 feet and\nsecondary or northern facing roads are likely already experiencing\nisolated slick spots, which will persist while new patches of\nblack ice develop across other roads overnight. Elsewhere...all\nlower valleys will quickly drop below freezing after sunset, which\nwill enable patchy black ice development, especially across\nsecondary and sheltered roadways. In areas where several inches of\nsnow fell and roads were not treated or plowed, the road may still\nbe snow covered and hazardous.\n\nAll areas will warm above freezing by 11 AM EST Sunday morning,\nwhich will effectively end the black ice threat.\n\nUse extra caution if you plan to travel through these areas tonight\nor Sunday morning. Reduce speed, avoid sudden breaking, and allow\nextra distance between you and the person in front of you.",
