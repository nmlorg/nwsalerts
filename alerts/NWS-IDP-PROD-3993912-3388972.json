Can't rule out localized 2 inch\nspots.\n\n* WHERE...Greater Reno-Carson City-Minden Area and Western\nNevada Basin and Range including Pyramid Lake.\n\n* WHEN...From 4 AM to 10 AM PST Thursday. Most of the snow should\nfall between 5 and 8 AM Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions especially on\nuntreated secondary and neighborhood roads. The hazardous\nconditions could impact the morning commute resulting in big\ndelays and traffic incidents. It doesn't take much snow to cause\nmajor travel problems in Western Nevada. Allow extra time for\ntravel.",
