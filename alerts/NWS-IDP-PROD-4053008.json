        "description": "ESFJKL\n\nA frontal zone oscillating north and south across the\nCommonwealth will be the focus of a series of disturbances moving\nthrough the Ohio and Tennessee valleys this week. This situation\nwill produce rounds of moderate, to at times heavy, rain over\nmuch of eastern Kentucky. The first of these will complete its\ntrack through eastern Kentucky by this morning. A second wave of\nheavier rain is expected from Wednesday through Thursday morning,\nwith the greatest rainfall rates expected Wednesday evening and\novernight into Thursday morning.\n\nThis added rainfall will fall on already saturated grounds,\nsetting the stage for the potential of more flooding and renewed,\nrapid rises on area creeks, streams, and rivers, especially along\nthe Cumberland River and for certain points on the Kentucky.\n\nRecent trends have been for the axis of heaviest rainfall to be\nshifted north and west. But there still remains considerable\nuncertainty with the details of this evolving situation.\n\nStay tuned to later forecast updates over the next couple of\ndays.",
