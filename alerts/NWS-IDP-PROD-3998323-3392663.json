Radar estimates exceed 3 inches in the Walnut\nCreek watershed near Springtown. In addition, street flooding has\nbeen reported in the Weatherford area. Excessive runoff from\ntoday's rainfall will continue to cause minor flooding,\nparticularly north Weatherford. This includes Willow Creek,\nGourdneck Creek, and Strickland Branch. Areas that are low-lying\nor usually experience poor drainage are most likely to experience\nflooding. This means some low water crossings may become\nimpassable.",
