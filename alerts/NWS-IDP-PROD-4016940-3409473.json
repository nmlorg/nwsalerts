Inexperienced mariners,\nespecially those operating smaller vessels should avoid\nnavigating in these conditions.\n\nA sudden onset of rough seas may cause hazardous conditions,\nwhich may occur suddenly at jetties and inlets. These conditions\ncould catch boaters by surprise. Boaters should use cautions when\nentering or exiting the inlets and jetty areas.",
