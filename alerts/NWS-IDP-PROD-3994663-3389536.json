A broad swath of 2 to 4 inch rains are expected,\nespecially along and to the east of highway 69, from midday\nFriday to the early morning hours on Saturday. A few locations\nmay pick up as much as 5 to 6 inches.\n\n* Since vegetation is dormant, more of this heavy rainfall will\nbecome runoff and will raise the quick onset flash flood threat.\nIn addition, several main-stem rivers are expected to flood from\nthe heavy rains, especially the Illinois, Poteau and Kiamichi\nriver basins.",
