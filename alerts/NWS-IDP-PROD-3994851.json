        "description": "A weather disturbance is bringing snow showers to northern\nNevada. These snow showers are moving steadily east so significant\naccumulation is not expected. However, snow intensity will be\nmoderate to heavy at times causing reductions in visibility and\nrapidly changing road conditions that will impact morning\ncommuters and travelers, including the I-80 corridor. Snow\nshowers are expected to diminish later today.\n\nMotorists should use caution when approaching these snow showers,\nas road conditions will quickly become slick, along with\nreductions in visibility.\n\nVisit www.weather.gov/elko for the latest weather information.",
