In addition, significant\nbeach erosion, overwash onto vulnerable low-lying coastal roadways,\nand surges within north and west facing harbors such as Haleiwa\nand Waianae will be possible this morning. The swells will begin\nto lower by late morning, with a steady decline expected this\nafternoon through tonight. Surf will likely remain at advisory\nlevels this afternoon along most north and west facing shores\nhowever, while the surf is expected to remain at warning levels\nalong west facing shores of the Big Island through the day.\n\n* WHAT...Surf will be 8 to 12 feet along west facing shores of\nthe Big Island.\n\n* WHERE...West facing shores of the Big Island.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM HST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...High...Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping\nacross portions of beaches, very strong breaking waves, and\nstrong longshore and rip currents. Breaking waves may\noccasionally impact harbors making navigating the harbor\nchannel dangerous.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of onshore winds, large\nsurf, and peak monthly tides could result in significant beach\nerosion, flooding of beaches that normally remain dry and\noverwash onto vulnerable low-lying coastal roads and other\ncoastal infrastructure.",
