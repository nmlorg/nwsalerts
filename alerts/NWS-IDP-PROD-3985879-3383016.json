        "description": "The National Weather Service in Greenville-Spartanburg has issued a\n\n* Flood Advisory for...\nEast central Greenville County in Upstate South Carolina...\n\n* Until 530 PM EST.\n\n* At 1130 AM EST, Doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated\nheavy rain which may cause minor flooding of low-lying areas\nwithin the Advisory area, including areas adjacent to rapidly\nrising streams. Up to one inch of rain has fallen since 10:30am,\nbut heavy rainfall is ongoing across the Greenville metro area and\nanother 1-2 inches of rainfall is expected over the next 60-90\nminutes.  This is expected to cause some area streams to approach\nand exceed bankfull which will cause flooding of adjacent low-\nlying areas.  Flooding of intersections, parking lots, and other\nlow-lying, poorly-draining roadways is expected.\n\n* Rapid rises on area streams and isolated nuisance flooding is\npossible including along: Reedy River, Brushy Creek, Laurel Creek,\nGilder Creek, Rocky Creek, and other tributaries into the Reedy,\nEnoree, and Saluda Rivers.\n\n* Some locations that may experience flooding include...\nGreenville Downtown, Greenville Eastside, West Greenville, Greer,\nMauldin, Taylors, Berea, Five Forks, Welcome and Travelers Rest.",
        "instruction": "Heavy rainfall will cause ponding of water in urban areas, streets\nand underpasses, as well as other poor drainage areas and low lying\nspots. Rapid rises on small creeks and streams will also occur,\npossibly flooding low water crossings and farmland. Do not attempt to\ntravel across flooded roads. Turn around, dont drown.\n\nA Flood Advisory means river or stream flows are elevated, or\nsignificant ponding of water in urban or other areas is occurring or\nis imminent.\n\nOnly when it is safe to do so, please report floodwaters flowing\nover roads or threatening property to the National Weather Service\nby calling toll-free, 1, 800, 2 6 7, 8 1 0 1, by posting on our\nFacebook page, or via Twitter using hashtag NWSGSP.\nYour message should describe the event and the specific location\nwhere it occurred, including roadways, nearby cross streets, stream\nnames, and other landmarks.",
