        "description": "An area of light snow was spreading into the southern parts of\nWest Virginia, western Virginia, and northwestern North Carolina\naround 2 AM EST this morning. The precipitation is generally west\nof a line from Union, to Blacksburg, to Mt. Airy, to Wilkesboro at\nthis hour. The precipitation is associated with a weak upper-level\ndisturbance moving eastward out of Kentucky.\n\nSnow accumulations are expected be light and remain mostly 1 inch\nor less. However, with temperatures hovering near or just below\nthe freezing mark, untreated roads, highways, and sidewalks could\nbecome slick and hazardous this morning, including for the morning\ncommute. If you plan to travel between now and 10 AM this\nmorning, allow extra time to reach your destination, reduce speed,\nand use extra caution in areas where the roads are covered with\nsnow.\n\nThe area of snow will move quickly eastward and should move\nout of the region by mid-morning. Road and highway conditions will\nimprove quickly once the snow ends later this morning and\ntemperatures warm above freezing.\n\nStay tuned to NOAA Weather Radio or commercial radio and\ntelevision for the latest weather information.",
