        "description": "Another round of rain, mixed with snow at times, was moving along\nthe Mississippi River in southeast Missouri and into southern\nIllinois.\n\nFor those traveling for the evening commute, be watchful for a\nrapid reduction in visibility due to rain, snow, and fog. Although\nmost visibilities will remain between one and three miles, some\nlocations may see visibilities may drop down near a half mile or\nless for a short period of time in snow and fog.\n\nThe best chance for seeing these reduced visibilities due to snow\nand fog will be along the western and southern edge of the band\nof precipitation currently moving through southern Illinois.\n\nSince temperatures will be mainly above freezing at the ground\nlevel this evening, any snow accumulations will be primarily on\ngrassy areas. The best chances for seeing up to half inch of snow\nbefore 6 pm will be from Perryville to Cape Girardeau eastward.\nAfter 6 pm, the better chances for snow development will be along\nand north of Route 13 in southern Illinois to Interstate 64.\n\nSome slick spots cannot be ruled out on area roads into this\nevening, primarily on bridges, overpasses, and secondary roads.\nUse extra caution as you travel in the affected areas.",
