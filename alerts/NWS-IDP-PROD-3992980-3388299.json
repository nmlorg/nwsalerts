        "description": "* WHAT...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, heavy freezing\nspray at a rate of 2 cm per hour or greater occurring, and may\nrapidly accumulate on vessels. For the Gale Warning, north\nwinds around 25 kt with gusts up to 40 kt and waves 8 to 11\nfeet occurring. For the Gale Watch, south winds 25 to 35 kt\nwith gusts up to 45 kt and waves 9 to 14 feet possible.\n\n* WHERE...Lake Superior West of Line from Manitou Island to\nMarquette MI Beyond 5NM from shore and Lake Superior East of a\nline from Manitou Island to Marquette MI and West of a line\nfrom Grand Marais MI to the US/Canadian Border Beyond 5NM from\nshore.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, until 10 AM EST\nthis morning. For the Gale Warning, until 7 AM EST this\nmorning. For the Gale Watch, from late tonight through\nThursday evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
