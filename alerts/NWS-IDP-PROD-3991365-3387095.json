For the Gale Warning, northwest\nwinds 20 to 30 kt with gusts up to 35 kt and waves 7 to 10\nfeet expected. For the Small Craft Advisory, west winds 20 to\n25 kt with gusts up to 35 kt and waves 6 to 9 feet occurring.\n\n* WHERE...Ontonagon to Upper Entrance of Portage Canal MI and\nBlack River to Ontonagon MI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 1 PM EST\n/noon CST/ this afternoon to 10 AM EST /9 AM CST/ Wednesday.\nFor the Gale Warning, until 4 AM EST /3 AM CST/ Wednesday. For\nthe Small Craft Advisory, until 7 AM EST /6 AM CST/ this\nmorning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
