        "description": "A pair of strong cold fronts will move across the Pacific\nNorthwest through the weekend, and the pattern will turn\nsignificantly colder next week. These cold fronts will likely\nbring heavy snow to the Cascades. Snow levels are expected to\nremain well above the valley floors through Sunday.\n\nThe colder air is expected to move into southwest Washington and\nnorthwest Oregon early next week, potentially cold enough to bring\nsnow levels down to the valley floor. An increasing number of\nforecast models are suggesting additional disturbances from the\nGulf of Alaska which would spread moisture into that colder air.\nThis will raise the chance for snow down to the lowest elevations\nnext week.\n\nWhile accumulations, distribution, and/or timing of snow remain\nuncertain, confidence is increasing in the overall threat of snow\nnext week, even for the lowest elevations. Now is a good time to\nmake sure you are prepared in the event that all of the necessary\ningredients come together for a significant snow event next week.",
