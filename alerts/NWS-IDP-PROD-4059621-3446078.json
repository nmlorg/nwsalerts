In\naddition, gusty north winds of 15 to 25 kt south of Cape Blanco\nwill create choppy wind driven seas this afternoon and evening.\nSeas will gradually subside late tonight into Saturday morning\nto 10 to 11 feet at 15 seconds.\n\n* WHERE...All areas.\n\n* WHEN...From 4 AM Friday to 10 AM PST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Building long period swell early this morning is\nlikely to increase the size of the surf zone as more breakers\noccur. Use extra caution when crossing bars, as they are likely\nto become especially dangerous. Additionally, gusty winds and/or\nsteep seas could capsize or damage smaller vessels.\n\n* View the hazard area in detail at\nhttps://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mfr/HAZARD",
