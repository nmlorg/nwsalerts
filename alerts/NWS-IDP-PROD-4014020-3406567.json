Additional showers and possibly a thunderstorm through\nthe remainder of this morning are expected. This will cause minor\nflooding in the advisory area.

Do not attempt to cross flooded\nroads. Find an alternate route.\n\nA Flood Advisory means river or stream flows are elevated, or ponding\nof water in urban or other areas is occurring or is imminent.",
