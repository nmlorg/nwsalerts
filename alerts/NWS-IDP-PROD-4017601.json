The snow will end from west to east starting in the late\nmorning hours Saturday. But west winds will begin to increase as\nthe snow ends. Blowing and drifting snow are likely during the mid\nto late afternoon hours Saturday, especially in central and east-\ncentral Wisconsin.\n\nPoor travel conditions are expected overnight and through much of\nthe day on Saturday. Be sure to use extra caution if traveling,\nand allow for extra time to reach your destination.",
