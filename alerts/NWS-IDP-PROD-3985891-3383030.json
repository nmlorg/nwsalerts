Most of the heavy\nrain has departed the area, but nuisance flood concerns will\ncontinue for the next several hours as it will take some time for\nstreams to rise, crest, and fall in response to the excess runoff.\n\n* Some area streams will likely approach and exceed bankfull witin\nthe next few hours which will cause flooding of adjacent low-lying\nareas. Flooding of intersections, parking lots, and other low-\nlying, poorly-draining roadways may be ongoing or imminent.\n\n* Rapid rises on area streams and isolated nuisance flooding is\npossible including along: Twelvemile Creek, Eighteenmile Creek,\nGeorges Creek, Big Brushy Creek, Three and Twenty Creek, Choestoea\nCreek, Coneross Creek, Seneca Creek and other\nassociated tributaries.\n\n* Some locations that may be experiencing flooding include...\nEasley, Clemson, Seneca, Powdersville, Piedmont, Central,\nPendleton, Liberty, Norris and Townville.",
        "instruction": "Heavy rainfall will cause ponding of water in urban areas, streets\nand underpasses, as well as other poor drainage areas and low lying\nspots. Rapid rises on small creeks and streams will also occur,\npossibly flooding low water crossings and farmland. Do not attempt to\ntravel across flooded roads. Turn around, dont drown.\n\nA Flood Advisory means river or stream flows are elevated, or ponding\nof water in urban or other areas is occurring or is imminent.\n\nOnly when it is safe to do so, please report floodwaters flowing\nover roads or threatening property to the National Weather Service\nby calling toll-free, 1, 800, 2 6 7, 8 1 0 1, by posting on our\nFacebook page, or via Twitter using hashtag NWSGSP.\nYour message should describe the event and the specific location\nwhere it occurred, including roadways, nearby cross streets, stream\nnames, and other landmarks.",
