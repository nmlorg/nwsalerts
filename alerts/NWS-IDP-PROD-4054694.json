        "description": "An arctic front will surge southward across central and southern\nMinnesota along with west central Wisconsin on Wednesday. This\nfront will be accompanied by light snow with accumulations of\naround an inch. Once the front moves through the area, a rapid\ndrop in temperatures will follow within an hour or two. These\nrapidly falling temperatures may lead to a flash freeze on area\nroadways. This is a condition where a small amount of snow that\nmelts prior to the frontal passage, or even vehicle exhaust or any\nliquid moisture on roads and walkways, will quickly freeze and\ncause black ice to form. Please be aware of this condition and\ndrive accordingly. In addition, strong northwest winds will\ndevelop behind this front leading to significant blowing and\ndrifting snow, especially in areas that received heavy snowfall on\nSunday.",
