Heavy freezing spray at a rate of 2 cm per hour or\ngreater possible, and may rapidly accumulate on vessels.\n\n* WHERE...Saxon Harbor WI to Black River MI, Black River to\nOntonagon MI and Ontonagon to Upper Entrance of Portage Canal\nMI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Watch, from late tonight through Tuesday\nafternoon. For the Heavy Freezing Spray Watch, from this\nevening through Tuesday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of stability.\nStrong winds can cause hazardous waves which could capsize or\ndamage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should consider altering plans to avoid or mitigate\nhazardous accumulation of ice on their vessel.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible\nhazardous conditions.  Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter\ncourse, and/or secure the vessel for severe wind and waves.",
