        "description": "***Snow Squalls Possible Today***\n\nAs of early this morning, snow showers with localized squalls are\nmoving eastward across Pennsylvania and are expected to reach the\narea by the mid to late morning time frame. Similar to summer\nsevere weather, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact areas that\nwill see intense squalls. However, we expect snow showers with\nlocally intense squalls to affect the region for the latter part\nof this morning continuing through much of this afternoon before\nwinding down by early this evening. Visibility may quickly drop to\na quarter of a mile or less in any squalls with a quick inch or\ntwo of snow accumulation possible leading to dangerous travel. In\naddition to the squalls, widespread wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph\nare expected for today.",
