This is a rather\ncompact, but vigorous storm system, and will bring a significant\nsnowfall to all but far northern Wisconsin. The storm is also fast\nmoving, so the snow will quickly diminish from west to east\nduring the late afternoon and evening.\n\nAlthough winds are not expected to be strong during the storm,\nthe heavy snowfall could reduce the visibility to under 1/4 mile\nat times, especially in central and east-central Wisconsin. This\nwill likely result in hazardous travel conditions. Air travel is\nalso likely to be affected by the storm.\n\n* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 6\ninches, with slightly lower totals north of Rhinelander.\n\n* WHERE...Langlade, Lincoln, Forest and Oneida Counties.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel will become hazardous.",
