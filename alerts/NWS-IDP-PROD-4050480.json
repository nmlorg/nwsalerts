        "description": "Rain re-developing across the central and northern Panhandle Sunday\nnight will intensify and become heavier into Monday and expand\ninto the southern Panhandle. Snow levels will also rise to around\n2000 feet and higher for much of the Panhandle with the exception\nof Upper Lynn Canal. Therefore, melting snow will cause open\nrivers to rise through Monday and Monday night. Some rivers with\nice cover may break up allowing levels to rise. In areas of the\nnorthern Panhandle with deeper snow-pack, expect very slick\nconditions and potentially significant ponding. To minimize\nponding, keep storm drains clear of snow and ice. Motorists may\nexperience slick conditions on untreated side streets. Pedestrians\nmay encounter very hazardous conditions when walking across\nmelting surfaces. Rain is forecast to exit the Panhandle Monday\nevening, but northern Panhandle residents can expect excess melt-\nwater to re-freeze Tuesday morning extending hazardous\nconditions.",
