        "description": "Low astronomical tides early Wed morning along the Southeast NC\nand Northeast SC coasts will drop to levels around -1.40 ft MLLW.\nThis will occur between 2 am and 5 am, with low tide occurring\naround 330 am EST. For a Low Water Advisory, levels have to drop\nto less than or equal to -2.00 ft MLLW.\n\nMariners should use extra caution while navigating close to shore\nand thru area inlets, keeping a watch out for exposed sandbars\nand shoaling. It's best to remain in the channel when navigating\nalong the IntraCoastal Waterway and follow the local aids to\nnavigation. A Depthfinder, a strong SpotLight and slow going are\nrecommended when navigating close to shore and the inland\nwaterways. In addition, allow extra mooring to counter the low\nwater levels.",
