Periods of greatly\nreduced visibility can also be expected along the higher ridge\ntops either side of the Mississippi River through the afternoon,\nthough widespread blizzard conditions are not likely.\n\nIf traveling through the afternoon and early evening, especially\nover the ridge tops or across southern Minnesota and northern\nIowa, be prepared that driving will be difficult to even dangerous\nat times with very low visibility. Additionally, be aware that\nrapidly falling temperatures will allow any earlier wet roads to\nrefreeze quickly.\n\n* WHAT...Widespread blowing and drifting snow, with whiteout\nconditions at times, especially outside of cities and towns.\nNorthwest winds gusting to 40 mph into late afternoon.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of southeast Minnesota and northeast Iowa.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on dangerous travel conditions with\nsignificantly lowered visibility, particularly for open and\nunsheltered areas outside of towns. Wind chills as low as 20\nbelow zero tonight could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as\nlittle as 30 minutes.",
        "instruction": "A Blizzard Warning means severe winter weather conditions are\nexpected or occurring. Falling or blowing snow with strong winds\nand poor visibilities are likely. This will lead to whiteout\nconditions, making travel extremely dangerous. Do not travel if\nat all possible. If you must travel, have a winter survival kit\nwith you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle.",
