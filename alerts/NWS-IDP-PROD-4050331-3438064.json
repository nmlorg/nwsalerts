Moderate to heavy snow will continue over\neastern Wisconsin late this afternoon, while the snow begins to\ndiminish over central Wisconsin. This storm is fast moving, so\nthe snow will quickly diminish from west to east during the late\nafternoon and evening.\n\nAlthough winds have not been strong during the storm, the heavy\nsnowfall has reduced the visibility to 1/4 mile at times,\nespecially in east-central Wisconsin. This has resulted in\nhazardous travel conditions. Air travel is also likely to be\naffected by the storm.\n\n* WHAT...Snow. Additional accumulations of 1 to 2 inches.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of central and northeast Wisconsin.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel will remain difficult due to snow-covered roads\nand reduced visibility.",
