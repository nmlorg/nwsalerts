For the Small Craft Advisory,\nnorthwest winds 15 to 20 kt with higher gusts and waves 4 to 8\nfeet.\n\n* WHERE...Port Washington to North Point Light WI, North Point\nLight to Wind Point WI and Wind Point WI to Winthrop Harbor IL.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, until midnight\nCST tonight. For the Small Craft Advisory, until 6 PM CST\ntoday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
