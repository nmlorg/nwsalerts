        "description": "Hazardous travel will linger overnight, mainly in open areas.\nAlthough scattered snow showers and flurries will continue,\nadditional snow accumulations will be minor outside of the Lake\nSuperior snowbelt. But west winds gusting to 30 to 35 mph at times\nwill produce some blowing and drifting of the snow. This could\nsignificantly reduce the visibility in open areas, especially on\nnorth-south roads. In addition, pavement can turn icy very quickly\nin areas where snow blowing across the road gets packed down by\ntraffic.\n\nBe sure to use extra caution if traveling overnight, especially\nin open areas. Slow down if you encounter reduced visibility due\nto blowing snow. Expect to encounter icy pavement in these areas,\nand leave plenty of distance between your vehicle and those around\nyou.",
