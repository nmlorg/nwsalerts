        "description": "Rain will increase in coverage over the Midsouth on Monday and\nlikely concentrate near cold front as it moves into central\nMississippi late Monday night. Portions of northeast Mississippi\nnear Tupelo have received 150 TO 200 percent of normal rainfall\nsince late January, and soils remain saturated in advance of this\nrainfall.\n\nAn additional round of showers and thunderstorms may bring locally\nheavy rainfall to a good portion of the Midsouth Wednesday.\n\nThere is a potential for 5 to 7 inches of rainfall by Thursday, south\nof a Charleston to Tupelo Mississippi line. This will likely elevate\nriver flooding potential.\n\nIn addition to the Midsouth proper, heavy rainfall is forecast\nfurther east into Alabama across the Tennessee River Basin. Like\nnortheast Mississippi, north Alabama has received 150 to 200\npercent of normal rainfall since late January. The Tennessee River\nwas already at Moderate Flood at Savannah, Tennessee this morning.\nAdditional heavy rainfall over the Tennessee River would likely\nexacerbate flooding.\n\nPlease monitor the latest rainfall and river forecasts. Be\nprepared to move to higher ground if a flood warning is issued for\nyour area.",
