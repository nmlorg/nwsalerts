Expect\nselect tributaries to rise above bankfull and water will likely\nencroach upon a few low lying locales.\n\nHAZARD...Flash flooding caused by thunderstorms.\n\nSOURCE...Radar and automated gauges.\n\nIMPACT...Flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas,\nhighways, streets and underpasses as well as other\ndrainage and low lying areas.\n\nExcessive rainfall over the warned area may cause mud slides near\nsteep terrain. The mud slide can consist of rock, mud, vegetation\nand other loose materials.",
