Snowpack across\nthe higher terrain will also melt, resulting in further runoff.\n\n* Heavy rain falling on nearly saturated ground will result in\nexcessive runoff. This may result in flooding of low lying\nareas and urban areas. Flooding is also possible on some\nlarger rivers as well, including the Black River, and other\nrivers that drain the Tug Hill Plateau and western\nAdirondacks.",
