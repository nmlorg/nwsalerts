The back edge was along a line from near Shelby to near\nMonida Pass. Movement was east at 30 mph.\n\nThis precipitation is mostly snow in the mountains and mostly rain\nat lower elevations, but rain has been changing over to snow fairly\nquickly. Also, some areas along the leading edge of the\nprecipitation are already below freezing, so there may be brief\nperiods of freezing drizzle there before becoming more of a mix of\nrain and snow.\n\nConditions can deteriorate rapidly in winter weather situations. Be\nprepared for snow or ice covered roads. Slow down and allow extra\ntime when traveling.",
