For the Small Craft Advisory, northeast\nwinds 10 to 20 knots with gusts up to 30 knots and waves 5 to\n8 feet expected.\n\n* WHERE...Oak Point to Saxon Harbor WI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, until 11 PM CST\nthis evening. For the Small Craft Advisory, until 4 PM CST\nSunday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nAnyone operating a smaller vessel should avoid navigating in\nhazardous conditions.",
