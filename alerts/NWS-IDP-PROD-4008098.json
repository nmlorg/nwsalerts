        "description": "For portions of northwest, north central and interior northeast\nIllinois tonight, including the Rockford area and the far west and\nnorthwest Chicago suburbs, there is some risk for freezing drizzle\ntonight. The risk for freezing drizzle would start during the mid\nto late evening and continue into the overnight hours, with\nduration depending on how long temperatures stay at or just below\nfreezing. Temperatures are expected to slowly rise overnight into\nTuesday morning, which would then end the risk for freezing\ndrizzle.\n\nIf freezing drizzle occurs tonight, then slick spots will be\npossible on roadways, especially elevated surfaces, and untreated\nor less heavily traveled roads. Motorists are advised to stay\ntuned to the latest forecast updates this evening, and be prepared\nfor the possibility of travel impacts into early Tuesday.",
