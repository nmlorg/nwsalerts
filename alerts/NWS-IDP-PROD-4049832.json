        "description": "Precipitation spreading into the area after 3 PM will likely begin\nas snow, and continue a few hours before changing to rain by early\nthis evening. Some of the snow will be moderate or even heavy in\nnature, with the potential for hourly accumulation rates to\napproach a half inch or even one inch per hour. A quick 1 to 2\ninches of snow is possible, with localized amounts near 3 inches\npossible from Celina to Kenton, where the heaviest snow rates have\nthe highest chance of developing.\n\nRoad surfaces will initially be warm enough to limit travel\nimpacts, but as snow rates increase and darkness approaches, some\nslippery travel is likely to develop across the area, as well as\nreduced visibility below a mile. Once the precipitation changes to\nrain and temperatures rise into the mid 30s, any travel impacts\nwill quickly improve.",
