Heavy rain\nhas fallen over the watch area in the last 24-36 hours.\nAdditional heavy rainfall is likely, with one to three inch\namounts possible, and localized heavier amounts exceeding\nthree inches. With an already saturated ground, flash flooding\nmay occur.\n\n* Since vegetation is dormant, and not consuming much ground\nwater, runoff from heavy rain will be increased. This elevates\nthe concern for flash flooding. Also, rapid rises may occur on\ncreeks, small streams, and flashy rivers.",
