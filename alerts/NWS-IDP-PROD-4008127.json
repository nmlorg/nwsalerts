        "description": "Patchy freezing drizzle is occurring across parts of western and\nsouthern Adirondacks and is spreading towards the eastern\nAdirondacks and Lake George Saratoga Region. Although\nprecipitation is very light, temperatures near or just below\nfreezing will allow this light precipitation to freeze on contact\nwith the ground. This will result in any untreated surfaces to\nbecome slippery with a thin coating of ice.\n\nIf traveling or walking through the early evening hours, keep in\nmind that icy conditions are possible across the area. Use caution\nand allow extra time to reach your destination.",
