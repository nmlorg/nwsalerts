Strong and gusty north\nwinds will gradually diminish through the rest of the\novernight. Until then, waves of 8 to 12 feet, occasionally to\n16, will result in a continued threat for lakeshore flooding.\n\n* WHERE...The shoreline areas of Porter County Indiana.\n\n* WHEN...Highest waves today with still at least minor lakeside\nflooding continuing tonight and possibly Sunday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...The winds and large battering waves combined with near\nrecord high lake levels will exacerbate already significant\nbeach and shoreline erosion sustained in the past several\nmonths. Flood prone paths and roads along the lake will be\nsusceptible to lengthy closures due to the expected long\nduration of high winds and waves. Heed any closures and stay\naway from the edge of the lake.",
