        "description": "An area of low pressure is expected to develop along the Gulf\nCoast and track offshore the Atlantic coast by Thursday afternoon.\nThis will allow rain initially to develop across the area by\nThursday morning. But as colder air filters into the area between\n10am and noon, a transition to a mixture of rain and snow is\npossible. During the afternoon hours, this mixture could briefly\nchange to all snow before quickly ending by mid afternoon.\n\nAccumulations are expected to remain limited with generally a half\ninch or less, except up to an inch at the highest elevations of\nDade and Walker counties. Also of concern is the fact that\ntemperatures will drop very quickly Thursday night into Friday\nmorning. Any moisture that remains on the roadways during this\ntimeframe will result in black ice which could create additional\nhazardous driving conditions.",
