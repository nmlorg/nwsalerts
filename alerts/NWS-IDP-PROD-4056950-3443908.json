For the Small Craft Advisory,\nnorthwest winds 15 to 25 kt with gusts up to 30 kt and waves 4\nto 7 feet.\n\n* WHERE...Sheboygan to Port Washington WI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 3 AM\nThursday to midnight CST Thursday night. For the Small Craft\nAdvisory, until 6 PM CST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nInexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller\nvessels, should avoid navigating in hazardous conditions.",
