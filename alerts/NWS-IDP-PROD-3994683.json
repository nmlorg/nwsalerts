Therefore, flooding issues are likely\nto develop rather quickly. Flooding of low-lying and poorly\ndrained areas, as well as low water crossings, can be expected.\nWhere the heaviest rains occur, more significant flooding\nproblems may develop.\n\nWater levels are already high on the Mississippi River and some\nof its tributaries as well as on the Tennessee River. Additional\nrainfall could lead to delayed crests or even higher crest levels.\nIn addition, new river flooding will be possible throughout the\narea.\n\nIndividuals, businesses, and governmental agencies with interests\nin or near flood prone areas should review their preparedness\nplans for potential flooding late this week.\n\nPlease stay tuned to the latest forecasts of this potentially\nsignificant heavy rainfall and flooding event.",
