These squalls have a history of producing 1 to 2 inches of\nsnow in less than one hour. The rapid development of snow covered\nroads is likely.\n\nHAZARD...Extremely poor visibility in heavy snow.\n\nSOURCE...Radar and webcams.\n\nIMPACT...Dangerous life-threatening travel.\n\n* This includes the following highways...\nInterstate 295 in New Jersey between mile markers 0 and 21.\nInterstate 95 in Pennsylvania between mile markers 0 and 15.\nInterstate 95 in Maryland between mile markers 91 and 109.\nNew Jersey Turnpike between exits 1 and 2.\nInterstate 95 in Delaware between mile markers 0 and 23.\nInterstate 476 in Pennsylvania between mile markers 0 and 12.\nInterstate 76 in Pennsylvania between mile markers 337 and 343,\nand between mile markers 345 and 348.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nPhiladelphia, Wilmington, Newark, Bridgeton, Middletown, West\nChester, Elkton, Havre De Grace, Calvert, Chester, West Deptford,\nPennsville, Coatesville, Yeadon, Westtown, Carneys Point,\nDowningtown, Folcroft, Swarthmore and Elsmere.",
        "instruction": "Consider avoiding or delaying travel until the snow squall passes\nyour location. If you must travel, use extra caution and allow extra\ntime. Rapid changes in visibility and slick road conditions may lead\nto accidents.\n\nThere is no safe place on a highway when a snow squall hits.\nVisibility and traction are immediately lost in whiteout conditions,\nmaking it difficult or impossible to slow down and avoid stopped\nvehicles. Delay travel or safely exit the highway before the snow\nsquall arrives.",
