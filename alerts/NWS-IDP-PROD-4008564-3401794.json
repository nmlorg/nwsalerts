        "description": "...A Flood Warning continues for portions of the following waterways\nin Indiana...\n\nDriftwood River...East Fork White River...Sugar Creek...Wabash\nRiver...White River...Wildcat Creek...\n\n\n.As of Monday evening, minor to moderate flooding continues on the\nWabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers in central and southern\nIndiana.  Flooding has ended along most of the creeks and smaller\nrivers.  Flooding is the result of up to about 4 inches of rain that\nfell late last week.\n\nThe large majority of the Wabash, White, and East Fork White Rivers\nare either in flood or expected to flood, with some locations\nreaching moderate flood stage.  Crests are expected to be the\nhighest since either February or June of 2019.\n\nThe Wabash River crested earlier today at Lafayette, Montezuma, and\nClinton.  The river will crest next around midnight Tuesday night at\nCovington and Terre Haute.  The crest on the White River was\napproaching Elliston.  The crest along the East Fork White River was\nbetween Seymour and Rivervale. Flooding along the lower portions of\nthe White and Wabash River is likely to continue through the end of\nthe month.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Thursday which\nwill allow smaller rivers to continue to recede this week.\nAbove normal precipitation is possible this coming Friday\ninto Saturday, which could exacerbate elevated water levels on area\nwaterways.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe East Fork White River at Williams.\n* until Tuesday January 21.\n* At  7:00 AM Monday the stage was 7.9 feet.\n* Flood stage is 8.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...Rise above flood stage by this morning and continue to\nrise to near 12.6 feet by Thursday evening.  It will fall below\nflood stage by Monday January 20.\n* At 13.2 feet...During the July 2015 summer flood, water began to\noverflow the road to the new Williams Bridge.  SR 450 closes in\nseveral locations. Most local roads in the flood plain are\nimpassable at this level.  Huron-Williams Road flooded south of\nPort Williams Road.  The summer flood crest of 13.2 feet came 3\nweeks later in the summer season than the June 28, 1960 crest of\n15.1 feet and is believed to be the latest for the summer season\nsince at least the late 1940s.",
        "instruction": "Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...\n\nMotorists should never drive into flood water. Turn around and go\nanother way. Keep children away from flooded areas. Recreational and\nagricultural interests should remain alert to changing river\nconditions.\n\nFor detailed flood information go to weather.gov/ind on the web and\nclick on rivers and lakes.",
