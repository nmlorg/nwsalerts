        "description": "Gale force winds continue to impact the coastal waters of\nAmerican Samoa due to an active monsoon trough across the area.\nSustained winds 30 to 35 knots, with higher gusts, can be expected\nthrough Tuesday morning.\n\nStrong winds coupled with large storm surges can generate hazardous\nwaves which could capsize or damage vessels. Widespread showers,\nheavy at times can also reduce visibility, especially near\nthunderstorms.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible hazardous\nconditions. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or\nsecure the vessel for severe wind and seas.\n\nListen to NOAA Weather Radio for the latest updates.
