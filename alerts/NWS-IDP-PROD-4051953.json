        "description": "At 115 PM EST, an area of light to moderate rain was moving across\nthe region.  This rain coupled with previous rain that occurred\novernight and this morning has caused the Middle Island Creek to\nrise.\n\nThe stream gages at Middlebourne and West Union have gone over their\nrespective action stages. As the Middle Island Creek rises this\nafternoon, minor flooding is possible, especially in poor drainage\nand low lying areas.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nSt. Marys, Middlebourne, Paden City, Sistersville, West Union, Alma,\nBlandville, Avon, New Milton, Arvilla, Point Lookout, Smithburg,\nWick, Lima, Hebron, Center Point, Sedalia and Canton.\n\nThis includes Route 50 in West Virginia between mile markers 47 and\n64.\n\nIn hilly terrain there are hundreds of low water crossings which are\npotentially dangerous in heavy rain. Do not attempt to travel across\nflooded roads. Find alternate routes. It takes only a few inches of\nswiftly flowing water to carry vehicles away.\n\nDo not drive your vehicle into areas where the water covers the\nroadway. The water depth may be too great to allow your car to cross\nsafely. Move to higher ground.",
