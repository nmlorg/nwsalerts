        "description": "Rainfall is expected over portions of the Mississippi\nValley, Midwest, and Great Lakes Regions beginning Thursday and\ncontinuing into the weekend. The potential for heavy rainfall\nacross portions of northeastern Illinois and northwestern Indiana\nis currently expected Friday into Saturday. Based upon current\nrainfall forecasts, significant flooding is possible in the\nKankakee and Iroquois River Basins.\n\nSoil moisture in some portions of the upper Midwest and Great\nLakes remains very high for early January. Soil moisture quickly\nincreases from near average in eastern Illinois and central\nIndiana to the 99th percentile in northern Illinois. River levels\nalso range from near average to much above average in these same\nregions. No snow cover or frozen soils currently exist across the\narea due to the lack of significant cold and snowfall in recent\nweeks. Based upon these antecedent conditions, the most\nvulnerable areas to heavy rainfall are southern Wisconsin and\nnorthern Illinois, including the Rock, Fox, and Des Plaines River\nBasins. Further to the south, including the Kankakee and Iroquois\nRiver Basins, more rainfall would be required to cause flooding.\n\nBy Sunday morning, storm total rainfall of at least one inch will\nbe likely across most of northeastern Illinois and northwestern\nIndiana. Some areas may receive up to three inches with locally\nhigher amounts. If this rainfall occurs, widespread river flooding\nwould occur as well as flooding of other low-lying and poor\ndrainage areas. Although uncertainty remains regarding the exact\nlocation and amounts of rainfall, the heaviest rainfall is\ncurrently expected to remain to the south of the most vulnerable\nriver basins. Even with drier soils and lack of snow cover,\nforecasted rainfall has the potential cause significant flooding. The\ntrack of this storm system will be monitored closely as\nminor adjustments to the north or south could cause drastic\nchanges to potential flooding extent and severity.\n\nThis outlook means that elevated water levels and potential\nimpacts are possible. Persons should closely monitor forecasts\nincluding the possibility of flood watches, warnings, and\nadvisories.",
