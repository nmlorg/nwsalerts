        "description": ".SYNOPSIS...\nA slow-moving frontal boundary dropping into the Southeast will\nprovide a focus for rain across the area as multiple disturbances\ntraverse the upper level flow. Widespread rain chances will shift\nnorth to south through the forecast area from Monday through\nThursday as the frontal boundary sags southward. Prolonged southerly\nflow with good fetch from the Gulf of Mexico combined with\nsouthwesterly flow aloft will contribute to deep moisture over north\nand central Georgia through Thursday, leading to the potential for a\nmulti-day heavy rain event. With some model uncertainty remaining\nwith respect to the placement and evolution of the front, changes to\nthe forecast rainfall totals can be expected in subsequent forecast\npackages, and may include slightly higher amounts.\n\n.RAINFALL EXPECTED...\nForecast rainfall amounts in the early and middle parts of the week\nare expected to be high. Current forecast rainfall totals for Monday\nthrough Thursday range from 3.5 to 5 inches over much of north and\ncentral Georgia, with some locally heavier rainfall totals possible.\nHigher rainfall amounts are expected in west-central Georgia between\nAtlanta and Columbus, where forecast totals during this time are\nanticipated to range from 5 to 6 inches. These rainfall amounts\nincrease the risk of flooding over the area.\n\nAlthough this prolonged rain is expected to begin as early as Monday\nmorning and end as late as Thursday evening, there will be some\nbreaks in the heaviest rain during this event. Wednesday and\nWednesday night will be the favored time for the heaviest rain for\nthe majority of the area.\n\n.ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS...\nIn spite of several days of dry conditions, soils remain moist\nacross the area and saturated in some locations, and some rivers\nremain in flood stage, particularly across portions of east-central\nGeorgia. As rainfall begins to accumulate through the middle of the\nweek, the ability for rivers to handle increased runoff within the\nchannel is suppressed and could quickly result in flooding.\n\n.IMPACTS...\nWith the expected rainfall amounts, isolated flash flooding is\npossible. Periods of heavy rain can overwhelm or clog storm drains\nand ditches with debris, particularly this time of year as fallen\nleaves block or impede stormwater systems. Take time ahead of the\nrain to clear leaves and debris from these drainage systems.\n\nMinor flooding of some of the larger creeks or rivers is likely with\nthe forecast storm total rainfall, especially as some of these\nchannels are already high from previous rainfall. A few rivers may\nexperience moderate flooding, as well. Quickly accumulating rainfall\ncan also produce widespread flooding of smaller, fast-responding\ncreeks.\n\n.ACTIONS...\nStay alert to changing forecasts.  A Flash Flood or Flood Watch may\nbe issued for north Georgia and possibly further south. Know what\ncounty you are in and the names of rivers and creeks in your area.\nDon't be caught off guard. Know what to do if a Flash Flood Warning\nis issued, particularly if you live or are visiting an area near a\ncreek or river.\n\nFor additional hydrologic information, visit our website at\nweather.gov/atlanta.
