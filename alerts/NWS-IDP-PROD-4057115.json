        "description": "Light snow or flurries will continue at times into early Thursday\nmorning. Total snow accumulation of 1 to 3 inches. The combination\nof new snow, or melting snow on pavement surfaces Wednesday\nafternoon and evening will continue to cause untreated roads,\nbridges, parking lots and sidewalks to be snow or ice covered.\nGusty northerly winds may also create some areas of blowing and\ndrifting snow.\n\nTemperatures around daybreak on Thursday are expected to fall\nto zero to 5 above zero. The combination of the cold temperatures\nand gusty northerly winds will produce wind chill readings in the\n10 below to 20 below zero range late tonight into Thursday morning.\nWind chill readings this low can produce frost bite in 30 minutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving tonight, as roads\nwill be slippery due to ice or snow cover. If venturing outdoors,\nwear layers of clothing along with a hat and gloves to protect\nyourself from the cold.",
