        "description": "Rain is spreading across eastern Kentucky and may reach areas\naround the I-64 corridor by dawn. As rain spreads north,\ntemperatures may be cold enough to allow rain to mix with and\nchange over to a brief period of snow. This could produce a thin\ncoating of snow around dawn. Accumulations should generally amount\nto under an inch, and will be more limited to grassy and elevated\nsurfaces. However, isolated slick spots could develop on area\nroadways, which may cause some travel concerns during the morning\ncommute. The threat of any snow will end by 9 am.",
