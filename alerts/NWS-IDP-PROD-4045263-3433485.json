A large,\nlong-period northwest swell is expected to build down the island\nchain tonight and peak Saturday, which will support advisory-\nlevel surf continuing along exposed coasts. A brief downward trend\nis expected Sunday, when surf heights should drop below advisory\nlevels.\n\n* WHAT...Surf will be 10 to 15 feet today, rising to 15 to 20\nfeet Saturday.\n\n* WHERE...North and west facing shores of Niihau and Kauai and\nnorth facing shores of Oahu, Molokai and Maui.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM HST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Moderate. Large breaking waves and strong currents\nwill make entering the water dangerous.",
