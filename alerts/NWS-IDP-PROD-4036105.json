        "description": "A large change in the weather pattern is expected Monday night. A\ncold front will bring below normal temperatures to the Panhandles\nstarting Monday evening. Early morning wind chills will be in the\nsingle digits in the northwest Tuesday morning. Cold wind chills\nwill continue each morning through Thursday morning for all of the\ncombined Panhandles. Wednesday morning will be the coldest with\nwind chills near or below zero across the western Panhandles.\nHypothermia and frostbite can set in quickly under these\nconditions, especially if skin is exposed to the elements.\n\nThe system bringing this cold front will also have the potential\nto bring potentially significant accumulating snow to portions of\nthe combined Panhandles. Two rounds of snow are expected, with\nthe first round expected in the west and northwest late Monday\nnight into Tuesday afternoon, and the second round Tuesday\nevening into Wednesday morning. While only minor accumulations\nare expected with the first round, the second round may bring\nimpactful snowfall to the far southern and southeastern Texas\nPanhandle.",
