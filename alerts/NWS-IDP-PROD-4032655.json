        "description": "A weather system is poised to move across the Quad State region\nthis evening and into the morning hours on Friday. As the\nmoisture moves into colder air overnight, some of the\nprecipitation will fall in the form of snow along the Interstate\n64 corridor from Mount Vernon Illinois to Winslow Indiana.\n\nSnowfall amounts are expected to remain light, generally a third\nof an inch or less. The best time period for snow accumulation\nwould be from 2 am to 6 am CST Friday morning. With the warmer\nground and road temperatures, most, if any accumulation would be\nlimited to grassy or elevated road surfaces, such as bridges.\n\nIf you live, or are planning travel, along Interstate 64 in\nsoutheast Illinois and southwest Indiana, be watchful for the\ndevelopment of snow overnight. Drive accordingly and allow extra\ntime to reach your destination.",
