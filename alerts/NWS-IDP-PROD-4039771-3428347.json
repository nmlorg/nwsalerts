        "description": "...The National Weather Service in Seattle has issued a flood warning\nfor the following rivers in Washington...\n\nTolt River Above Carnation affecting King County\nSnoqualmie River Near Snoqualmie Falls affecting King County\nSnoqualmie River Near Carnation affecting King County\nCowlitz River Below Mayfield Dam affecting Lewis County\n\nHeavy rain has started and is forecast to last through Friday\nmorning. Combined with the heavy rain event this last weekend, this\nis driving rivers flowing off of the Cascades above flood stage to\nmoderate or major flood. With the amount of water in the Cowlitz\nriver and reservoirs, even that river below Mayfield Dam will go to\nflood flow.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Seattle has issued a\n\n* Flood Warning for\nThe Snoqualmie River Near Snoqualmie Falls\n* from Thursday morning to Friday evening.\n* At 12:45 PM Wednesday the flow was 6950 cfs.\n* Flood flow is 20000 cfs.\n* Moderate flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...The river will rise above flood flow around 6 AM\nThursday and crest near 39431 cfs around 10 PM Thursday. The river\nwill fall below flood flow Friday early afternoon.\n* Impact...At 30000 cfs, the Snoqualmie River will cause widespread\nflooding of pasture lands and roads along the river from the town\nof Snoqualmie downstream through Fall City. Roads that may become\nflooded include Fall City-Carnation...Tolt Hill...and Novelty Flats\nRoads. This river level on the Snoqualmie corresponds roughly to a\nphase 3 flood in the King County flood system.",
        "instruction": "Do not drive cars...vans...or trucks through flooded areas...this is\nthe cause of most flood related deaths in Washington. Be alert for\nrapid changes and monitor developments by listening to NOAA Weather\nradio or other local media.",
