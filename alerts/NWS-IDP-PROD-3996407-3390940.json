For the High Rip\nCurrent Risk, dangerous rip currents expected.\n\n* WHERE...Southern Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie, Martin,\nCoastal Volusia and Northern Brevard Counties.\n\n* WHEN...For the High Surf Advisory, until 10 AM Saturday. For\nthe High Rip Current Risk, through this 7 PM evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Dangerous swimming and surfing conditions and\nlocalized beach erosion. Rip currents can sweep even the best\nswimmers away from shore into deeper water.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The next high tide cycles along the east\ncentral Florida coast will occur between 700 and 730 AM this\nmorning, 730 and 800 PM this evening, and between 800 and 830 AM\nSaturday morning.\n\nWhile rip currents will be present all day, the threat will be\nhighest between 1030 AM and 430 PM due to tidal effects.",
        "instruction": "High surf will affect the beaches in the advisory area, producing\nlocalized beach erosion and dangerous swimming conditions.\nSwimmers should remain out of the water due to large breaking\nwaves and dangerous surf conditions.\n\nRip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away\nfrom shore, which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the\nsandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as jetties and\npiers. Heed the advice of lifeguards, beach patrol flags and\nsigns.\n\nSwim near a lifeguard. If caught in a rip current, relax and\nfloat. Don't swim against the current. If able, swim in a\ndirection following the shoreline. If unable to escape, face the\nshore and call or wave for help.",
