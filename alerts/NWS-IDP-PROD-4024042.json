Although snow and ice\naccumulations are light, roads may quickly become covered with\nsnow and ice, resulting in slippery travel for the morning\ncommute. Accidents have been reported in some areas.\n\nPlan ahead for a slower, slippery drive this morning. Slow down on\nsnow and ice covered roads and allow extra time to reach your\ndestination.",
