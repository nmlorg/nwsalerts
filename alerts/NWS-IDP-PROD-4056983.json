        "description": "Light snow will taper off to flurries this evening, except across\nVilas County where scattered snow showers will linger into\nThursday morning. Any additional snow accumulation should be less\nthan an inch, except for locally higher amounts across the\nsnowbelt region of northwest Vilas County.\n\nThe combination of the snow, along with melting snow from this\nafternoon and falling air temperatures well below freezing could\ncause roads to become icy. Gusty northerly winds may also create\nsome areas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nOvernight, temperatures are expected to fall into the single\ndigits below zero. The combination of the cold temperatures and\ngusty northerly winds will produce wind chill readings in the\n15 below to 25 below zero range late tonight into Thursday\nmorning. Wind chill readings this low can produce frost bite\nwithin 30 minutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving tonight, as roads\nwill be slippery due to ice or snow. If venturing outdoors, wear\nlayers of clothing along with a hat and gloves to protect yourself\nfrom the bitter cold.",
