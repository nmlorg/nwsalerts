        "description": "* WHAT...Freezing rain producing ice accumulations around a half\nto three quarters of an inch are expected. Sleet and snow may\nmix in at times, mainly north of I-69, but just light\naccumulations if at all. Winds could gust as high as 40 mph,\nwhich may further increase later Sunday morning.\n\n* WHERE...Huron, Saginaw, Tuscola, Sanilac, Shiawassee, Genesee,\nLapeer, Livingston and Oakland Counties.\n\n* WHEN...From 4 AM Saturday to 7 AM EST Sunday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Power outages and tree damage are likely due to the\nice and strong winds. Travel could become nearly impossible.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures are expected to fall below\nfreezing early Saturday morning. There remains uncertainty where\nthe line of freezing temperatures and therefore freezing rain\nwill advance through the day Saturday, which will dictate which\nareas see the highest ice accumulations. Currently the freezing\nline looks to stall across central Livingston and Oakland\nCounties resulting in a large gradient of ice accumulation from\nnorth to south across those counties.",
