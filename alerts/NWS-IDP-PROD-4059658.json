        "description": "An active winter storm system will bring a combination of winds\nand snow to portions of East Idaho beginning late Saturday and\ncontinuing into Sunday night. Although forecast snow accumulations\ncontinue to fluctuate slightly as the event nears, there is high\nconfidence that the Saturday night through Sunday time period will\nhave the potential to produce moderate to locally heavy snow\nmainly over higher elevations of East Idaho. The areas expected\nto see the greatest impact will be north of Ketchum through\nStanley, including the higher elevations of the Sawtooth\nRecreation Area, as well as most of the higher elevations east of\nInterstate 15 to the Wyoming border. Accumulations in these areas\nare expected to fall in the 8 to 12 inch range for most locations\nwith locally higher amounts at pass level. Winds are expected to\nincrease as well, so areas of blowing and drifting snow may\nfurther complicate already potentially hazardous driving\nconditions. People living in or traveling through East Idaho this\nweekend should continue to monitor the forecast for updates and be\nprepared for winter travel conditions.",
