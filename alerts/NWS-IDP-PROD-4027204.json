The visibility at\nthe Okeechobee County Airport had dropped to 400 yards.\n\nThe fog is expected to spread into adjacent sections of Saint\nLucie and Martin Counties before sunrise. Persons driving in this\narea, particularly on major roads such as the Florida Turnpike,\nU.S. Highways 98 and 441, and State Roads 70, 710 and 714 should\nprepare for the possibility of encountering rapid reductions in\nvisibility from dense fog through around 800 or 900 AM.\n\nWhen driving in dense fog, reduce your speed, use your low beam\nheadlights, and leave extra distance between your vehicle and the\none in front of you.",
