        "description": "A complex weather pattern will impact northern and central New\nMexico Thursday through Friday. Initially, subtropical moisture\nstreaming over New Mexico will overrun a colder and drier airmass\nassociated with a cold front forecast to sag into the eastern\nplains today and into the Rio Grande Valley tonight. This combination\nwill bring widespread rain and snow to the west and north, as\nwell as potential for a wintery mix of precipitation to portions\nof the eastern plains. There is considerable uncertainty, but at\nthis time it appears the Interstate 40 corridor from the Clines\nCorners area to Tucumcari as well as locales north to Clayton and\nsouth to Clovis may have the greatest potential of seeing areas of\nfreezing rain resulting in slick and hazardous travel conditions\nThursday morning.\n\nMountain snow continuing Thursday night will taper off Friday,\nwith the greater accumulations anticipated across the northern\nmountains. Snow accumulations are also possible stretching from\nthe Las Vegas to Santa Fe and Estancia areas and along the\nContinental Divide. The remainder of Friday will feature very\nstrong and possibly damaging westerly winds gusting to around 60\nmph along the Sangre de Cristo mountains into northeast New Mexico\nas the subtropical moisture is swept out of the state and an\nupper disturbance swings through the central Rockies.\n\nAnyone planning travel through northern and central New Mexico\nThursday through Friday should be prepared to encounter adverse\nweather conditions. Monitor NOAA weather radio, weather.gov/abq or\nyour local media for the latest weather updates. For the latest\nNew Mexico road conditions visit nmroads.com or call 5-1-1.",
