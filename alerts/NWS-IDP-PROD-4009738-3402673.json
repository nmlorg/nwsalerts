In addition, accumulating\nsmall hail will be possible in coastal low elevations late\nWednesday night and Thursday. Travel will likely become dangerous\nor even temporarily impossible in some high elevation areas, so\nplease prepare now.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow likely above 2500 feet. 2 to 5 inches\nbetween 2500 and 3500 feet, with totals near one foot possible\nabove 3500 feet.
