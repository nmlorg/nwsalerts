        "description": "Locally strong and gusty winds will persist through Friday\nmorning along the eastern slopes of the Prairie Coteau in\nnortheast South Dakota. Southwesterly winds of 25 to 40 mph with\noccasional gusts over 50 mph are expected. The locations most\naffected would be the higher terrain areas of the Prairie Coteau\nas well as up to 15 miles east of the hills. This would include\nInterstate 29 between Summit and Peever, or between mile markers\n210 and 225. U.S. Highway 12 from Summit to Milbank may also\nexperience strong winds. The strong winds will create areas of\nblowing and drifting snow, with reduced visibility and icy road\nconditions possible. Anyone with travel plans across far\nnortheast South Dakota this afternoon through Friday morning\nshould be prepared for inclement weather and are urged to slow\ndown and allow for extra distance between vehicles if need be.",
