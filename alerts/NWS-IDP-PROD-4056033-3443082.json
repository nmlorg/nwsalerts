East of this area,\nwinds will remain high, but visibilities are not expected to drop\nto blizzard criteria, but areas of blowing snow will continue\nthrough the afternoon.\n\nPlummeting temperatures this afternoon and evening may lead to\nflash freezing of this light snow on roadways and surfaces, with\nimpacts to the evening commute expected.\n\nTemperatures will continue to drop off sharply behind the Arctic\nfront. Wind chill values will average 25 to 35 degrees below zero\nover west central Minnesota, with wind chills of 35 to 40 degrees\nbelow zero likely by the evening.
