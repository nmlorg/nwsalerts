        "description": "A large area of rain, locally heavy, will move northeast at 40 mph\nacross the western and northern Piedmont through 1000 AM. Minor\nflooding in urban and poor drainage areas will occur due to the\nalready saturated ground. Rainfall amounts of between 0.50 and\nlocally 1 inch through 1000 AM are expected in the Winston-Salem,\nGreensboro, Asheboro, Burlington, and Roxboro areas.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nGreensboro, Winston-Salem, Durham, High Point, Chapel Hill,\nBurlington, Asheboro, Lexington, Henderson and Graham.",
        "instruction": "Locally heavy rain will quickly reduce visibility and result in\nponding of water on roadways, standing water in low lying areas, and\nminor flooding of creeks, streams, and areas of poor drainage.\nDrivers are urged to slow down and use extra caution to avoid\nhydroplaning, especially in urban areas where prolonged heavy rain\ncan quickly lead to flooding.",
