        "description": "The recent rain and snowfall has left many area roadways wet.\nTemperatures have fallen below the freezing mark across much of\nthe region this morning and this is contributing to the\ndevelopment of patchy black ice on road surfaces. Bridges and\noverpasses will be especially prone to black ice development and\nslippery conditions. In addition, areas of fog have developed\nwhich may reduce visibility very quickly over short distances. The\nfog could also freeze on some elevated surfaces.\n\nMotorists are urged to use extreme caution while driving this\nmorning. Slow down, allow extra travel time, and be on the\nlookout for black ice and freezing fog conditions. Temperatures\nare expected to warm back above freezing throughout the area by\n10 or 11 am, ending the threat of black ice and freezing fog.",
