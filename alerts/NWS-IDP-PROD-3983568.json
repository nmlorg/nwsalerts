        "description": "Rapid changes in water levels of the Missouri River from Misty\nWaters Marina up through Price are still occurring. The collecting\nof ice in the river has been, and will continue to cause rising\nwater upstream of the leading edge of stationary ice. As of early\nNew Year's day, the upstream edge of stationary ice is just south\nof Double Ditch Historical Site, or just under two miles north of\nHoge Island. Over the next 24 hours, the river will run out of\nmobile ice and what has been a northward advancing ice cover will\nquickly turn into a southward retreat as the warmer weather over\nthe next few days results in the loss of ice and lower water\nlevels. Regrettably, cooler weather next week suggests that the\narea is likely to see yet another icing event late in the first\nfull week of January.",
