The core of heaviest precipitation occurred\nwithin 50 miles north and south of Interstate 70 across the state.\nThe bulk of the water will show up in the White River south of\nIndianapolis, where crests are expected to be up to about 5 feet\nabove flood stage.  Flooding along the lower reaches of the Wabash\nand White Rivers currently are predicted to last until the end of\nnext week.\n\nThe latest forecast model data is now predicting flood crests along\nthe White River to be lower than what was predicted Monday morning.\nThis will give us crests lower than what we saw in January.\nPredictions for the Wabash are very similiar to Monday's\npredictions.\n\nFlood impacts should mainly be confined to roads near the waterways,\nagricultural land, bottomlands, and levees.  Please see the specific\nimpacts listed for your location of interest below or by going to\nthe web page described below.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Covington.\n* from Wednesday evening to Sunday morning.\n* At 10:45 AM Tuesday the stage was 11.4 feet.\n* Flood stage is 16.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...Rise above flood stage by Wednesday evening and continue\nto rise to near 16.6 feet by Thursday afternoon.  It will fall\nbelow flood stage by Saturday evening.\n* At 16.0 feet...Low agricultural lands begin to flood.  Backyard\nflooding of cottages on right bank starts a short distance upstream\nof gage.  Critical stage of Young-Neal Levee is reached.",
