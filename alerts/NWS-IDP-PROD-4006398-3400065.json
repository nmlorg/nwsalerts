Strong trade winds will deliver abundant moisture,\nwhile a low aloft continues to provide instability, potentially\nfueling locally heavy rainfall. Any heavy showers that develop\nwill lead to runoff in streams and rivers, increasing the\npotential for flash flooding.",

Do not cross fast\nflowing water in your vehicle or on foot.\n\nBe prepared to take action if a Flash Flood Warning is issued.
