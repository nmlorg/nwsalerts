        "description": "A long series weather disturbances will move across the Pacific\nNorthwest beginning Friday, and continues through much of next\nweek. These weather systems will bring periods of heavy snow to\nthe Cascades and the potential for moderate to heavy rain at lower\nelevations through Sunday. Two significant cold frontal passages\nare also expected, which will bring lowering snow levels from\nSaturday night into next week, with an increasing risk of snow\nreaching the valley floors next week.\n\nMuch colder air is expected to spread into southwest Washington\nand northwest Oregon early next week, potentially cold enough to\nbring snow levels down to the valley floor. While specifics on\naccumulation amounts, areal distribution, and/or timing of snow\nremain uncertain, we continue to have confidence in some risk for\nlow elevation snow next week. Now is a good time to make sure you\nare prepared in the event that all of the necessary ingredients\ncome together for low elevation snows and associated travel\nimpacts during the middle part of next week.",
