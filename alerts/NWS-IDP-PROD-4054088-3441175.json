Gusty northwest winds and light snow\nimmediately behind the front may lead to areas of blowing snow\nover northern Iowa, including the potential for near-blizzard\nconditions in northwest Iowa where recent appreciable snowfall has\noccurred. Rapidly falling temperatures also accompany the front,\nwhich could lead to a flash freeze if local roads are in a wet or\nslushy condition.\n\nBitter cold temperatures and breezy winds combine to drop wind\nchill values to dangerously cold levels late Wednesday night into\nThursday morning.\n\n* WHAT...Very cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as low as\n30 below zero.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of central and south central Iowa.\n\n* WHEN...From 4 AM to noon CST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...The cold wind chills could cause frostbite on\nexposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.",
