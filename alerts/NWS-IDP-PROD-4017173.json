        "description": "Travel conditions are expected to deteriorate across central and\neast-central Wisconsin late this afternoon as a band of snow\noverspreads the area. At 440 pm, the leading edge of the snow\nextended from near Eau Claire to Marshfield to Wautoma to near\nMilwaukee. The snow was spreading northeast at 35 mph, and should\nbegin in the Stevens Point, Wausau, and Oshkosh, and Appleton\nareas by 530 pm, and in the Shawano, Green Bay, and Manitowoc\nareas around 600 pm. The snow will overspread north-central and\nnortheast Wisconsin during the evening hours.\n\nThe snowfall intensity will pick up quickly once the snow begins,\nwith moderate to occasionally heavy snow possible within 1/2 hour\nof the onset of the snow. As a result, travel conditions are\nlikely to deteriorate very quickly. If you are traveling across\ncentral or east-central Wisconsin late this afternoon, be prepared\nfor a quick onset of poor travel conditions. If possibly try to\nreach your destination prior to the arrival of the snow.\n\nOnce the snow begins it will continue overnight, though the\nintensity will diminish at times.",
