        "description": "A low pressure system moving by to our south is expected to\ngenerate light amounts of wintry precipitation tonight and\nWednesday morning, mainly across parts of southeastern Missouri\nand adjacent parts of southern Illinois. Snow and sleet\naccumulations of up to an inch are possible in the higher\nelevations of the Missouri Ozark Foothills, with lesser amounts\nexpected elsewhere.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to hover near the freezing mark during\nthis time. This, combined with relatively warm road surface\ntemperatures, will tend to limit any impacts to travel. However,\ndrivers should still be watchful for any slick spots that might\ndevelop on elevated road surfaces, such as bridges and overpasses.",
