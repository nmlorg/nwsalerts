This\nwill result in mostly rain and wet road conditions across the\npasses of Highway 299, and just minor accumulations, if any, along\nHighway 36. However, up to a foot of snow will be possible at\nScott Mountain Summit on Highway 3.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow expected above 4500 feet. Total snow\naccumulations of 3 to 14 inches. Winds gusting as high as 45\nmph.\n\n* WHERE...Northern Trinity County including Scott Mountain\nSummit on Highway 3.\n\n* WHEN...Until 3 PM PST today.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult to impossible. The\nhazardous conditions could impact the morning commute. Chain\nrequirements over Scott Mountain Summit and periods of road\nclosure are possible. Blowing and drifting snow could make\nvisibility poor.",
