        "description": "...HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING EXPECTED ACROSS THE WESTERN\nCAROLINAS AND NORTHEAST GEORGIA TODAY...\n\n.Abundant moisture arriving on southwest flow ahead of an\napproaching cold front will produce widespread heavy rain\nshowers across the region today. The heavy rainfall will have the\npotential to produce flooding in many locations, with landslides\nalso possible in the mountains.\n\nThe Flash Flood Watch continues for\n\n* portions of northeast Georgia and western North Carolina,\nincluding the following areas, in northeast Georgia, Habersham\nand Rabun. In western North Carolina, Avery, Buncombe, Burke\nMountains, Caldwell Mountains, Graham, Haywood, Henderson,\nMacon, Madison, McDowell Mountains, Mitchell, Northern\nJackson, Polk Mountains, Rutherford Mountains, Southern\nJackson, Swain, Transylvania, and Yancey.\n\n* through this evening\n\n* Heavy rainfall is already occurring over the mountains early\nthis morning. Rainfall rates will increase today, with rates of\n1/2 to 1 inch per hour possible in the heaviest downpours. Most\nmountain locations have already received 1 to 2 inches of\nrainfall, with some spots in the Smokies already seeing 3 inches\nof rain. It is quite likely that rainfall totals will reach 4\nto 6 inches by the end of the day, with locally higher amounts\nin the southernmost mountains. This excessive rainfall will\ncause flooding to develop and worsen through the day and into\ntonight.\n\n* Rapid rises above bankfull on streams and creeks are likely to\noccur today, along with the threat of flooded roadways. Flooding\nis also likely on larger rivers, and this flooding would linger\nthrough Friday. The persistent, heavy rainfall will greatly\nincrease the risk of landslides through the day and into\ntonight.",
        "instruction": "Rainfall of more than five inches in similar storms has been\nassociated with an increased risk of landslides and rockslides.\nIf you live on a mountainside or in a cove at the base of a\nmountain, especially near a stream, be ready to leave in advance\nof the storm or as quickly as possible should rising water,\nmoving earth, or rocks threaten. Consider postponing travel along\nmountain roads during the period of heavy rainfall.\n\nA Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead\nto flash flooding. Flash flooding is a very dangerous situation.\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action\nshould Flash Flood Warnings be issued.",
