The combination of the large surf, strong\nonshore winds, high astronomical tides, and elevated ocean water\nlevels will produce wave runup and localized coastal erosion\nalong east facing shores during the next few days.\n\n* WHAT...Surf to 10 to 15 feet through Saturday.\n\n* WHERE...East facing shores of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, and\nBig Island.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM HST Saturday, though the elevated surf will\ncontinue into early next week.\n\n* IMPACTS...High. Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping\nacross portions of beaches and select low lying roads, very\nstrong breaking waves, and strong longshore and rip currents.\nBreaking waves may occasionally impact harbors making\nnavigating the harbor channel dangerous.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of the large surf, strong\nonshore winds, high astronomical tides, and elevated ocean\nwater levels will produce wave runup and localized coastal\nerosion along east facing shores during the next few days.",
