        "description": "The heaviest snow is winding down, with light snow expected to\nlinger across much of the West Coast and Interior. A stalled\nweather front will remain situated across the region, supporting\ncontinued snowfall through Thursday. Snow may periodically\nincrease in intensity, resulting in reduced visibility and\ndifficult travel conditions. Areas generally south and east of\nEmmonak to Koyuk to Shungnak can expect to pick up an additional 1\nto 3 inches per day through Thursday. The front is expected to\nmove south Thursday, giving way to clearing skies and colder\ntemperatures.",
