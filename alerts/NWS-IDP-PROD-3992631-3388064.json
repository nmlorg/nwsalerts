This snow could impact the Wednesday morning\ncommute for the Kimball, Montreal, Gile, and Hurley areas. This\ncold air and breezy winds will also lead to very cold wind chills\ntonight across most of northeastern Minnesota with readings of -25\nto -35 degrees expected.\n\nMore snow will develop Wednesday night into Thursday. The highest\naccumulation is expected along portions of the North Shore which\nmay see 6 inches or more.\n\n* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Advisory, very cold wind chills as\nlow as 35 below zero. For the Winter Storm Watch, heavy mixed\nprecipitation possible. Total snow accumulations of 4 to 6\ninches, except 3 to 8 inches for the higher terrain of the North\nShore and ice accumulations of a light glaze possible.\n\n* WHERE...Northern Cook and Lake, Southern Cook and Southern\nLake Counties. This includes the Tribal Lands of the Grand\nPortage Reservation.\n\n* WHEN...For the Wind Chill Advisory, until 10 AM CST Wednesday.\nFor the Winter Storm Watch, from Wednesday evening through\nThursday afternoon.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult.
