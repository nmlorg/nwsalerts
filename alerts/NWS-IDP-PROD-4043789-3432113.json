        "instruction": "Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Do not attempt to cross\nwater-covered roadways, bridges, or low-level crossings. Only a few\ninches of rapidly flowing water can carry away your vehicle. It is\nnot worth the risk. Please TURN AROUND, DON'T DROWN.\n\nBe especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the\ndangers of flooding. Numerous roads, parking lots and bridges will\nbe threatened by heavy rain and rapidly rising streams and creeks.\nPlease pay close attention to road signs indicating a flood-prone\narea. Obey all barricades, even if water is not currently over the\nroad. Barricades are in place for your protection and indicate areas\nwhere flooding can occur rapidly and without warning.",
