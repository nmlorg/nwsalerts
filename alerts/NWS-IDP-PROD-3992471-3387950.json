While\nshowers will be possible over most areas, the most susceptible\nto flooding will be windward areas which have already received\nrain this week.\n\n* The extended period of rain could cause flooding in low spots\nwhich could make some roadways impassable. Debris in streams and\ngulches may clog bridges and culverts. Strong winds may cause\ntree branches to fall which will add to the amount of possible\ndebris.",
        "instruction": "A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions are favorable for flash\nflooding. Flash flooding is LIFE THREATENING. Do not cross fast\nflowing water in your vehicle or on foot.\n\nMonitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action if a Flash\nFlood Warning is issued. If you experience heavy rain or rising\nwater, head to higher ground immediately.",
