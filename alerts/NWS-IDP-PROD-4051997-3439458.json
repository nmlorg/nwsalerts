        "description": "...HIGH SURF WARNING FOR NORTH AND WEST FACING SHORES OF NIIHAU\nKAUAI OAHU MOLOKAI AND NORTH FACING SHORES OF MAUI AND WEST\nFACING SHORES OF THE BIG ISLAND...\n\n.The combination of a long-period northwest swell and strong\nnorthwest winds associated with a low pressure system just north\nof the state, will bring large and dangerous surf to most north\nand west facing shores at least through tonight. This will likely\nresult in significant beach erosion, overwash onto vulnerable\nlow-lying coastal roadways, and surges within north and west\nfacing harbors such as Haleiwa and Waianae.\n\n* WHAT...Surf will be 20 to 30 feet along north and west facing\nshores of Niihau and Kauai, as well as north facing shores of\nOahu, Molokai, and Maui. Surf will be 12 to 20 feet along west\nfacing shores of Oahu and Molokai.\n\n* WHERE...North and west facing shores of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu,\nMolokai, and north facing shores of Maui.\n\n* WHEN...Through 6 AM HST Tuesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...High. Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping\nacross portions of beaches, very strong breaking waves, and\nstrong longshore and rip currents. Breaking waves may\noccasionally impact harbors making navigating the harbor\nchannel dangerous.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of strong onshore winds,\nlarge surf, and peak monthly tides will likely cause\nsignificant beach erosion, flooding of beaches that normally\nremain dry and overwash onto vulnerable low-lying coastal\nroads and other coastal infrastructure.",
