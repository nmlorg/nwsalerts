        "description": "...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER CONDITIONS POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY ACROSS\nPARTS OF FAR SOUTHWEST NEBRASKA...\n\n.Increasing southwest winds with gusts up to 30 mph ahead of an\napproaching surface trough will combine with warmer than normal\nseasonable temperatures. Highs are forecast to be 15 to 20\ndegrees above normal with lower to mid 60s. This combination will\npromote afternoon humidity as low as 15 percent with decent\npotential for upper level winds to mix down given a well-mixed\nforecast boundary layer and decent mixing layer height. There is\npotential for even lower humidity below 15 percent locally as\nwell, albeit with lower confidence in that at this time. Lastly,\nfuels are anticipated to be favorable. With critical fire weather\nconditions, any fires that may occur have a high potential to\nspread rapidly and may be difficult to control.\n\nThe National Weather Service in North Platte has issued a Fire\nWeather Watch FOR WIND AND LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY, which is in\neffect from Wednesday morning through Wednesday afternoon.\n\n* Affected Area...In NEZ210...Fire Weather Zone 210 Frenchman\nBasin.\n\n* Winds...Southwest 15 to 20 mph with gusts up to 30 mph.\n\n* Relative Humidity...As low as 15 percent, lower cannot be ruled\nout.\n\n* Impacts...Any fires that may occur have a high potential to\nspread rapidly and may be difficult to control.",
