        "description": "An Arctic front will surge southward across western, central,\nsouthern Minnesota, as well as west central Wisconsin on\nWednesday. This front will be accompanied by light snow. Once the\nfront moves through your area, expect a rapid drop in temperatures\nin an hour or two. These rapidly falling temperatures could lead\nto a flash freeze on area roadways. This is a condition where a\nsmall amount of snow that melted prior to fronts arrival, or\nwater, will quickly freeze and cause black ice to form. Please be\naware of this condition and drive accordingly. In addition,\nstrong northwest winds will develop behind this front leading to\nsignificant blowing and drifting snow, especially in areas that\nreceived heavy snowfall on Sunday.",
