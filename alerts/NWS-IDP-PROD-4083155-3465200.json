        "description": "...The Flood Warning continues for the Missouri River near\nWilliston, affecting Williams and McKenzie Counties of North Dakota.\n\n.Warm temperatures will continue to clean snowpack off the\ncountryside and increase river flows. Much of the cause behind this\nevent can be attributed to the ice covering the river. As the river\nrises, the risk of the ice becoming mobile increases as will the\nrisk of an icejam. If an icejam were to occur, water levels can\nquickly rise and fall several feet within a few hours.  .\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nthe Missouri River near Williston.\n* From Tuesday evening until further notice.\n* At 8:45 AM CST Monday / 7:45 AM MST Monday the stage was 21.8 feet.\n* Flood stage is 22.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...The river is expected to rise above flood stage\ntomorrow evening and continue rising to a crest of 23.5 feet early\nFriday afternoon.\n* Impact...At 20.0 feet, Ditches in the vicinity of the river will\nfill and wildlife management lands along the south banks will\nbegin to flood.\n* Impact...At 22.0 feet, Low-lying farmland and access roads to oil\nwell sites near Trenton are flooded. City of Williston does not\nflood.\n* Impact...At 24.0 feet, Water begins to cover oil well location\nsouth and east of Williston. Wildlife management areas are\nflooded. City of Williston does not flood.\n* Flood History...This crest compares to a previous crest of 22.2\nfeet on 06/30/2008.",
        "instruction": "Motorists should not attempt to drive around barricades or drive on\nflooded roads.\n\nTurn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nBe especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize the\ndangers of flooding.\n\nAdditional forecast information is available under the Rivers and\nLakes tab at www.weather.gov/bis.",
