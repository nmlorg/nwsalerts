Although individual showers are not remaining\nover any one area for a prolonged period, showers are repeatedly\nforming over northern and interior areas of Kauai, and water\nlevels will be rising in streams and rivers.\n\n* Locations in the advisory include but are not limited to...\nKilauea, Anahola, Wailua, Hanalei, Na Pali State Park, Wainiha,\nNorth Fork Wailua Trails, Moloaa, Princeville, Polihale, Kokee\nState Park and Wailua Homesteads.",
        "instruction": "Stay away from streams, drainage ditches and low lying areas prone to\nflooding.\n\nRainfall and runoff will also cause hazardous driving conditions due\nto ponding, reduced visibility and poor braking action.\n\nDo not cross fast flowing or rising water in your vehicle, or on\nfoot. Turn around, don't drown.",
