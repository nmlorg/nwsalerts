        "description": "Melting of recent snowfall due to sunshine and traffic will\ncreate patchy areas of black ice on roadways this evening across\nthe western mountains of North Carolina.\n\nTemperatures are already below freezing above 3500 feet and\nsecondary or northmen facing roads are likely currently\nexperiencing isolated slick spots, which will persist while new\npatches of black ice develop across other roads overnight.\nElsewhere...all lower valleys will quickly drop below freezing\nafter sunset, which will enable patchy black ice development,\nespecially across secondary and sheltered roadways.\n\nAll areas will warm above freezing by 11 AM EST Sunday morning,\nwhich will effectively end the black ice threat.",
