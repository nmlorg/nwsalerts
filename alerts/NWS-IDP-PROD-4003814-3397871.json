Rainfall rates\nbetween one and two inches per hour are occurring with the\nheaviest showers, which will lead to increased water levels in\nstreams and rivers.\n\n* Locations in the advisory include but are not limited to...\nKilauea, Anahola, Hanalei, Haena, Na Pali State Park, Wainiha,\nKapaa, Wailua, Moloaa, and Princeville.",

Turn around, don't drown.",
