        "description": "...HEAVY RAINFALL AND POTENTIAL FLASH FLOODING THROUGH TODAY...\n\n.A slow-moving frontal boundary will continue to bring moderate\nto heavy rainfall to the southwest North Carolina mountains,\nparts of northeast Georgia, and far western Upstate South\nCarolina today. With the ground saturated from heavy rainfall\nlast week, and many streams running at elevated levels, additional\nflash flooding is expected to redevelop within the watch area\ntoday. In addition, some main stem river flooding is likely to\ndevelop within and close to the watch area.\n\nThe Flash Flood Watch continues for\n\n* portions of northeast Georgia, western North Carolina, and\nupstate South Carolina, including the following areas, in\nnortheast Georgia, Franklin, Habersham, Hart, Rabun, and\nStephens. In western North Carolina, Graham, Haywood, Macon,\nNorthern Jackson, Southern Jackson, Swain, and Transylvania.\nIn upstate South Carolina, Anderson, Greater Greenville,\nGreater Oconee, Greater Pickens, Greenville Mountains, Oconee\nMountains, and Pickens Mountains.\n\n* through this evening\n\n* Additional rainfall amounts through today are expected to range\nfrom 1 to 3 inches across the Piedmont, with locally higher\namounts expected. In light of the saturated ground and elevated\nstream flows resulting from last week's heavy rainfall, this\nrainfall will likely result in development of localized flash\nflooding, some of which could be significant.\n\n* Rapid rises above bankfull on streams and creeks may occur,\nalong with the threat of flooded roadways. Flooding is also\nlikely to re-develop on main stem rivers in and close to the\nwatch area.",
        "instruction": "A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead\nto flash flooding. Flash flooding is a very dangerous situation.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action\nshould Flash Flood Warnings be issued.",
