        "description": "Multiple periods of rainfall since the first of January, including\n1 to 4 inches in the lowlands this last weekend, has increased soil\nmoisture to high levels across western Washington. Moderate to heavy\nrainfall is expected again Wednesday into Friday with up to 4 or\nmore inches in the lowlands and foothills. This amount of rain will\nput extra pressure on soil instability, leading to an increased\nthreat of landslides being triggered through the period and\nimmediately after.\n\nAreas above 5000 feet in elevation will see mostly snow and not be\naffected.\n\nFor more information about current conditions, visit\nwww.weather.gov/seattle, select Hydrology, and then scroll down\nfor the links to the landslide information pages.\n\nFor more information on landslides, visit the website for the\nWashington State Department of Natural Resources landslide\ngeologic hazards at: http://bit.ly/2mtA3wn",
