        "description": "...EXTENDED PERIOD OF WINTER WEATHER CONTINUES...\n\n.Numerous cold, wet weather systems will continue to push through\nthe area over the next several days. Colder air is expected to\narrive with each sequential wave, thus snow levels will steadily\nlower through the weekend. Many winter weather headlines have\nbeen extended out though Tuesday, or have been expanded to cover\nmore area. Winter weather will continue into the middle of next\nweek.\n\n* WHAT...For the Winter Storm Warning above 2500 feet, heavy\nsnow expected. Total snow accumulations of 10 to 15 inches.\nWinds gusting as high as 45 mph. For the Winter Weather\nAdvisory between 2000 and 2500 feet, snow expected. Total snow\naccumulations of 2 to 6 inches.

The winter weather advisory covers elevations\nbetween generally 2000 and 2500 feet, including the Interstate\n5 passes north of Grants Pass.\n\n* WHEN...From 4 AM Monday to 10 AM PST Tuesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel could be very difficult due to slick and snow\ncovered roads, and may impact the morning commute. Periods of\ngusty winds may produce lower visibilities due to blowing and\ndrifting snow.\n\n* View the hazard area in detail at\nhttps://www.wrh.noaa.gov/mfr/HAZARD",
        "instruction": "* Travel is strongly discouraged because of dangerous conditions.\n\n* If you must travel, keep tire chains, a flashlight, blankets,\nfood, water, medications, and a fully charged phone with you.\n\n* The safest place during a winter storm is indoors.\n\n* A Winter Storm Warning means that severe winter weather is\nlikely and poses a threat to life and property.
