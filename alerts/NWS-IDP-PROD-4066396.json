        "description": "Lake-effect snow showers are expected to continue overnight with\nadditional snowfall accumulations of up to 2 inches possible. The\nprimary concern will be the brief reductions in visibilities\nwithin localized heavier snow bands. Winds gusting up to 35 mph\nwill lead to areas of blowing and drifting snow, which may also\nreduce visibilities at times. Motorists are encouraged to reduce\nspeed, increase following distance, and exercise caution if\ndriving overnight.",
