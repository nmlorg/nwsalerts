Some showers will however occasionally\nbring briefly heavier bursts of rain. Streams and rivers remain\nhigh, and ponding of water continues in low-lying areas. Water\nlevels in the Wailuku River remain elevated, and residents in\nupper Piihonua should be prepared to take immediate action if\nwater levels rise further, or if a Flash Flood Warning is issued.\n\nLocations in the advisory include but are not limited to...\nHakalau, Piihonua, Hilo, Pahala, Paauilo, Waipio Valley, Orchidlands\nEstates, Piihonua, Pahoa, Puna, Pepeekeo, Keaau, Honokaa, Ookala,\nHawaiian Paradise Park and Kawa Flats.",
        "instruction": "Stay away from streams, drainage ditches and low lying areas prone to\nflooding.\n\nRainfall and runoff will also cause hazardous driving conditions due\nto ponding, reduced visibility and poor braking action.\n\nDo not cross fast flowing or rising water in your vehicle, or on\nfoot. Turn around, don't drown.",
