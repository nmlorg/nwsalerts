The hazardous\nconditions could impact the Friday morning commute.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A wintry mix is expected tonight into\nFriday, but there is the potential for at least a brief period\nof time where temperatures could rise above freezing Friday\nafternoon, and any precipitation would be drizzle or rain. Even\nif this does occur, a strong cold front sweeping through Friday\nnight could result in flash-freezing of area roads. Any\nlingering light snow falling Friday night with the gusty\nnorthwest winds could result in reduced visibilities.",
