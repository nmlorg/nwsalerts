Areas that are low lying or usually\nexperience poor drainage are most likely to experience flooding.\nThis means some low water crossings in the region may become\nimpassable. Up to two inches of rain have already fallen.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nDallas, Garland, Richardson, University Park, Addison, Highland\nPark and Buckingham.",
        "instruction": "Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nExcessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of small\ncreeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses as\nwell as other drainage areas and low lying spots.",
