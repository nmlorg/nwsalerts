Total rainfall amounts may\nreach 1.5 to 2.0 inches. Snowpack across the higher terrain will\nalso melt, resulting in additional runoff.\n\n* Heavy rain falling on nearly saturated ground will result in\nexcessive runoff. This may result in flooding of low lying\nareas and urban areas. Flooding is also possible on some\nlarger rivers as well, including the Black River, and other\nrivers that drain the Tug Hill Plateau and western\nAdirondacks.",

Those living in areas prone to\nflooding should be prepared to take action should flooding\ndevelop. Stay tuned to weather radio or other radio and tv\nstations for further details or updates",
