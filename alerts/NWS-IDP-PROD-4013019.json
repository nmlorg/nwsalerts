        "description": "Warm and humid onshore flow is expected to continue across cooler\nwaters, allowing marine fog to persist overnight. Coastal\nwebcams, satellite imagery, and local observations continue to\nshow patchy fog across the lower Texas coast. Marine visibility\nwill generally vary between 2 and 5 nautical miles, with dense\nmarine fog reducing visibility to 1 nautical mile or less at\ntimes. A Dense Fog Advisory may be needed if visibilities remain\nbelow 1 nautical mile for an extended period of time.\n\nMariners are advised to navigate with caution in nearshore areas\nand in the vicinity of jetties and bridges, as visibilities may\nchange rapidly.",
