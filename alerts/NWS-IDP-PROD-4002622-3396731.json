Strong winds are still possible in\nthis area into the late afternoon and early evening hours,\ndecreasing markedly by the middle of the evening.\n\n* WINDS... South to west and northwest winds 15 to 25 mph may gust\nup to 40 mph at times. These winds will all shift to the\nnorthwest after the passage of a cold front.\n\n* IMPACTS... Saturated soils may enable these gusty winds to\ndown loosely rooted trees. The strong and variable winds will\nalso present a potential traffic hazard, especially for high\nprofile vehicles. These winds may also hamper clearing efforts\nfor those locations damaged by storms early this morning.",
