Dense fog may develop eastward to\nColby and Oakley through 7 AM MST.\n\nAdditionally, decreasing cloud cover and falling temperatures\nwill freeze lingering moisture on area roads, particularly in\nvicinity of Interstate 70 where isolated showers wet the pavement\nearlier this morning.\n\nDrivers are urged to slow down and exercise additional caution,\nparticularly at intersections and highway onramps and offramps\nwhere accidents are more likely to occur, and on elevated roadways\nsuch as bridges and overpasses where ice is more likely. Use low\nbeam headlights and be prepared for rapid reductions in\nvisibility, especially near rivers, creeks and other low lying\nareas.",
