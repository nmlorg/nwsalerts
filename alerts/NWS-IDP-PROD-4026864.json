The visibility may change rapidly over short distances.\n\nIf driving in the region tonight, allow extra travel time and\nstopping distance. Use low beam headlights and fog lamps to\nimprove your vision while driving, and consider turning on your\nhazard lights in particularly dense fog to be more visible to\nother drivers.",
