Initially, storms may sit\nfor several hours Northeast Arkansas and the Missouri Bootheel\nFriday evening before finally pushing east. Torrential downpours\nwill possible with the storms. Since vegetation is dormant, and\nnot consuming much ground water, runoff from heavy rain will be\nincreased. This elevates the concern for flash flooding.
