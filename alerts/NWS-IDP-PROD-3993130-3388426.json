        "instruction": "Mariners should alter plans to avoid strong winds and very steep\nseas. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or\nsecure the vessel for severe conditions.\n\nA Small Craft Advisory means that winds and seas will create a\npotential hazard to smaller vessels and inexperienced mariners.\n\nA Gale Warning means winds of 34 to 47 knots are imminent or\noccurring. Operating a vessel in gale conditions requires\nexperience and properly equipped vessels. It is highly recommended\nthat mariners without the proper experience seek safe harbor prior\nto the onset of gale conditions.\n\nA Hazardous Seas Warning means very steep and hazardous sea\nconditions are imminent or occurring. Recreational boaters should\nremain in port, or take shelter until waves subside.  Commercial\nvessels should prepare for rough seas and consider remaining in\nport or taking shelter in port until hazardous seas subside.\n\nA Hazardous Seas Watch is issued when the risk of very steep and\nhazardous seas has significantly increased, but the specific\ntiming and/or location is still uncertain. It is intended to\nprovide additional lead time for mariners who may wish to\nconsider altering their plans.",
