The core of heaviest precipitation occurred\nwithin 50 miles north and south of Interstate 70 across the state.\nThe bulk of the water will show up in the White River south of\nIndianapolis, where crests are expected to be up to about 5 feet\nabove flood stage.  Flooding along the lower reaches of the Wabash\nand White Rivers currently are predicted to last until the end of\nnext week.\n\nThe latest forecast model data is now predicting flood crests along\nthe White River to be lower than what was predicted Monday morning.\nThis will give us crests lower than what we saw in January.\nPredictions for the Wabash are very similiar to Monday's\npredictions.\n\nFlood impacts should mainly be confined to roads near the waterways,\nagricultural land, bottomlands, and levees.  Please see the specific\nimpacts listed for your location of interest below or by going to\nthe web page described below.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River at Spencer.\n* until further notice.\n* At 11:30 AM Tuesday the stage was 15.2 feet.\n* Flood stage is 14.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue rising to near 16.6 feet by late\nWednesday night then begin falling.\n* At 16.3 feet...County Line Road south of Gosport begins to flood.",
