        "description": "...Blowing Snow and Dangerous Cold Ahead...\n\n.A strong Arctic cold front will pass through the state this\nafternoon and evening. Strong northwest winds and light snow\nimmediately behind the front may lead to areas of blowing snow\nover northern Iowa, including the potential for near-blizzard\nconditions in northwest Iowa where recent snowfall has occurred.\nRapidly falling temperatures will also accompany the front, which\ncould lead to a flash freeze if local roads are wet or slushy.\n\nBitter cold temperatures and breezy winds combine to drop wind\nchill values to dangerously cold levels late Wednesday night into\nThursday morning.\n\n* WHAT...For the Wind Chill Warning, dangerously cold wind\nchills expected. Wind chills as low as 35 below zero. For the\nWinter Weather Advisory, light snow and blowing snow expected.\nTotal snow accumulations of up to one inch. Winds gusting as\nhigh as 35 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of west central and north central Iowa.\n\n* WHEN...For the Winter Weather Advisory, from 6 PM this evening\nto midnight tonight. For the Wind Chill Warning, from midnight\ntonight to noon Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions. Blowing snow could\nsignificantly reduce visibility. The hazardous conditions\ncould impact the evening commute. The dangerously cold wind\nchills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as\n10 minutes.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures will plummet and it is\npossible that wet or slushy roads could flash freeze, creating\nicy spots on roadways late Wednesday afternoon or evening.",
