        "description": "A strong cold front is sliding south across the eastern plains of\nColorado and will progress southwest into New Mexico overnight\ninto Thursday. The front, combined with a disturbance moving east\nacross Colorado, will bring a round of snow to portions of north\ncentral and northeast New Mexico tonight. Several inches of snow\naccumulation are expected between the northern Sangre De Cristos,\nRaton Pass and much of Union County, where a Winter Weather\nAdvisory is in effect. A mix of light snow, freezing drizzle and\nfreezing fog is forecast closer to Interstate 40 across the\neastern plains and the eastern highlands south to near Ruidoso\nThursday morning. Hazardous travel impacts are looking more likely\nThursday along Interstate 25 between Las Vegas and Raton, along\nInterstate 40 from Tijeras to the Texas border and along US 285\nfrom near Clines Corners south toward Roswell.\n\nAnyone planning travel in eastern New Mexico tonight through\nThursday morning should be prepared for potential adverse weather\nconditions with icy or snow-covered roads and low visibility in\nfog and snow. Monitor NOAA weather radio, weather.gov/abq or your\nlocal media for the latest weather updates. For the latest New\nMexico road conditions visit nmroads.com or call 5-1-1.",
