        "description": "* WHAT...During the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, heavy freezing\nspray at a rate of 2 cm per hour or greater expected, and may\nrapidly accumulate on vessels. During the Gale Warning, expect\nsustained winds up to 28 knots from the southwest with gusts\nup to 38 knots. The largest significant waves will be 10 feet\nwith a potential maximum wave height of 14 feet.\n\n* WHERE...Lake Huron from Presque Isle Light to Sturgeon Point\nMI beyond 5NM off shore, Lake Huron from Sturgeon Point to\nAlabaster MI beyond 5NM off shore and Lake Huron from Port\nAustin to Harbor Beach beyond 5NM Off Shore.\n\n* WHEN...The maximum winds are expected around 8 AM EST Saturday\nwith the largest waves expected around 12 PM EST Saturday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
