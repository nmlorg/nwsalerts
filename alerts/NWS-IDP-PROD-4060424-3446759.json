Though visibilities are not being significantly reduced,\nas the snow blows over the roads, it is causing ice to form,\nleading to slippery road conditions. Given the southerly wind\ndirection, the worst conditions are occurring on east to west\noriented roads.\n\n* WHAT...Blowing snow. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of south central, southwest and west central\nMinnesota.\n\n* WHEN...Until midnight CST tonight.\n\n* IMPACTS...Blowing snow will reduce visibility and lead to patchy\nice forming on roads. The hazardous conditions could impact the\nevening commute.",
