        "description": "A fast developing area of low pressure will move through the\nTennessee Valley and Southern Appalachians tonight into Tuesday.\nThis will bring a round of light snow to much of eastern Kentucky\nafter midnight into Tuesday morning with some small accumulations\nof snow possible. The roads and ground temperatures will be above\nfreezing during the snow minimizing its impact. Most places will\nsee just a half an inch or less of snow from this. The best\nlocations for accumulations will be on elevated surfaces like\nwooden decks and railings - along with grassy surfaces. Use\ncaution during the morning commute as an isolated slick or slushy\nspot may be found on area roadways.",
