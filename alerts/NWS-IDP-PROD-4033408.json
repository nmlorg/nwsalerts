The main impact will\nlikely be across Interstate 29, south of Sisseton to near Summit.\nAround the Peever area, winds will be strongest, with snow likely\ncovering the road at times, especially near overpasses.\n\nTravel impacts are possible due to slick and sporadic snow\ncovered roads. Take extra precautions if you pan to travel, and\nplan for quick changes in road conditions.",
