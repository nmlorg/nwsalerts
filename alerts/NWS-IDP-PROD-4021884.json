        "description": "River ice has developed on several northern Illinois and\nnorthwest Indiana rivers early this week, including formation of\nsome ice jams. Favorable conditions will continue for river ice\nand probable ice jam development for the following rivers and\ntheir tributaries...Rock, Fox, DuPage, Des Plaines, and Kankakee.\nThis risk will continue through late this week.\n\nDue to the current well below freezing temperatures through early\nthis week, conditions will remain favorable for rapid river ice\nformation. Ice jams will also be likely, with the highest risk\nalong the Rock, Fox, and lower Kankakee Rivers. Ice jams may\ncause rises on area rivers with little warning.\n\nThis outlook means that elevated river levels and potential\nimpacts are possible, but the timing, extent, and severity remain\nuncertain. Persons with interests along area rivers should closely\nmonitor the latest forecasts.",
