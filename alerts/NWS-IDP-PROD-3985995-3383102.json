        "description": "* At 155 PM EST, Doppler radar indicates the earlier heavy rainfall\nhas ended across Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens counties; however, an\narea of 1-3 inches of rainfall occurred between approximately 9:30am\nand noon, causing flooding of low-lying areas and roadways.\n\n* Several reports of flooded roads have been received by local media\nand law enforcement, especially in the urban centers of Central,\nClemson, Easley, and Pendleton.  These roads include: Grant Street\nin Easley, Central Road in Pendleton, Isaqueena Trail and Berkeley\nRoad in Clemson, and Pinedale Road in Central.  Roadway flooding\nof less than 12\" depth may continue for a few more hours as runoff\ncontinues to work through area streams.  It is important to\ncontinue to heed all barricades and seek an alternative route.\n\n* Area streams continue to rise, though cresting should be imminent\nfor most streams.  Nevertheless, additional flooding adjacent to\nstreams is likely over the next few hours as it takes a while for\nexcessive runoff to work through the soils and into adjacent\nstreams.  Therefore, avoid streams and adjacent areas through the\nafternoon.\n\n* The following streamgauge is exceeding Action/Advisory Stage:\nEighteenmile Creek at SC 28 in Pendleton.\n\nCurrent Stage: 10.49 feet and rising slowly.\nForecast: Eighteenmile Creeek will continue to rise to near\n11 feet before cresting.\nAction Stage: 10.5 feet.\nMinor Flood Stage: 6.0 feet.\nImpacts: At 11.0 feet the creek will be flooding low-lying areas\nadjacent to SC 28 and flooding of Bishop Branch Rd. and Central Rd.\nis likely.\n\n* Some locations that will continue to experience flooding include...\nEasley, Clemson, Seneca, Powdersville, Piedmont, Central,\nPendleton, Liberty, Norris and Townville.\n\n* Additional heavy rainfall is possible this afternoon and evening.\nGiven the very wet antecedent conditions, any additional heavy\nrainfall may prompt new rounds of flooding.  Please stay weather\naware.",
        "instruction": "Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles.\n\nHeavy rainfall is causing significant ponding of water in urban\nareas, streets and underpasses, as well as other poor drainage areas\nand low lying spots. Rapid rises on small creeks and streams is\noccurring, possibly flooding low-water crossings and farmland. Do\nnot attempt to travel across flooded roads.",
