        "description": "WHAT: Rainfall totals of 2 to 4 inches with locally higher\namounts are possible this weekend. This amount of rain will\nlikely lead to flooding along rivers and streams as well as in\nlow\nlying areas prone to flooding. Current forecasts suggest the\nheaviest rain may fall across south central and southern Indiana.\nHowever, it remains very early and forecast details will likely\nchange this week.\n\nWHEN: Rain is expected to start as early as Thursday Afternoon.\nThe heaviest rainfall would occur between Friday and Satuirday\nnight. Flooding would develop over the weekend and continue into\nnext week.\n\nCONFIDENCE STATEMENT: Confidence is medium to high on the storm\nsystem impacting the region this weekend. Confidence on the\nlocation of heavy rainfall and degree of flooding across central\nIndiana remains low at this time.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION: There is a good chance that at least\nminor flooding will develop along some rivers and streams this\nweekend and continue into next week. There is also a small chance\nthat moderate flooding could develop along rivers within the area\nof highest rainfall. If rainfall amounts exceed 4 inches, there\nis also a small possibility that major flooding could develop\nalong a few rivers.\n\nPeople living in flood prone locations should monitor forecasts\nthis week on this developing hazardous weather situation. Now is\nthe time to think about preparedness and plan for impacts in the\nevent the heavy rainfall and flooding materialize.",
