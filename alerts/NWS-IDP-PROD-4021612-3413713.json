Seas will build to\n4 to 8 feet late in the day.\n\n* WHERE...Lower Straits of Florida, Hawk Channel from west end\nof Seven Mile Bridge to Halfmoon Shoal, and Gulf of Mexico\nfrom west end of Seven Mile Bridge to Halfmoon Shoal out to 5\nFathoms.\n\n* WHEN...In Effect.\n\n* IMPACTS...A Small Craft Advisory means that wind speeds of 20\nto 33 knots, or seas of 7 feet or greater, are expected to\nproduce hazardous conditions for small craft. These hazardous\nconditions may result in poor vessel handling and steering\nresponse, broaching, overturned dinghies and kayaks, slips and\nfalls on slippery decks, rub damage along docks and seawalls,\nswamped bows at reef tract mooring balls, and dragging anchors.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The wind increase will occur suddenly due\nto passage of a strong cold front.",
