Near complete ice cover should be expected within\nthe next couple days for the Missouri River between Morton and\nBurleigh counties. Higher water levels are expected up north of\nthe Bismarck Mandan area. Even though problematic high water is\nrare this time of year, it cannot be ruled as ice forms and shifts.\nDue to the length of colder weather expected, ice formation and\nhigher water on the Missouri River between Oliver and McLean\ncounties is likely as well.",
