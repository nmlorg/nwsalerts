This band of snow\nwill continue to move southeast into the Idaho Falls area between 6\nand 7 PM MST and the Pocatello and American Falls area sometime\nafter 7 PM MST.  Expect accumulating snow on roadways north of\nBlackfoot as road temperatures are currently below freezing. South\nand west of Blackfoot, road temperatures were warm enough to melt\nsome of the snow initially before dropping below freezing during the\nevening at which point some of the liquid may freeze while snow\naccumulates across roadways. If you are going to be out and about\nthis evening, be sure to use caution and slow down as roads may\nbecome very slick.\n\nLocations impacted include...\nIdaho Falls, Rexburg, Blackfoot, Rigby, Driggs, Swan Valley, Felt,\nRirie Reservoir, Goshen, American Falls Reservoir, Lorenzo, Ammon,\nShelley, Aberdeen, Victor, Iona, Sugar City, Ucon, Menan and Teton.",
