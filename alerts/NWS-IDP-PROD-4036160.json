        "description": "Winter precipitation is likely to occur Tuesday night into\nWednesday across West Central Texas. Much colder air will invade\nthe area following a strong cold frontal passage on Tuesday. A mix\nof rain, snow and sleet is initially expected to develop Tuesday\nevening north of a San Angelo to Coleman line, with mainly rain to\nthe south. Then there will be a changeover to snow overnight\nthrough Wednesday morning across the area north of a line from\nOzona to Brownwood, with a mix of snow, freezing rain and sleet\nsouth of that line.\n\nWith temperatures dropping below freezing, accumulating snowfall\nis likely to occur across central and northern parts of West\nCentral Texas. Heavy snow amounts appear likely across the Big\nCountry, while snow accumulations in the Concho Valley and\nHeartland are more uncertain. Regardless, it appears that a least\nlight snow accumulations will occur in those counties. Any snow\nand sleet accumulations will make for hazardous road conditions\nfor motorists.\n\nAlthough accumulating snow is less likely across the I-10 corridor,\nthere is the possibility of brief periods of freezing rain Wednesday\nwhich could cause light ice accumulations on roadways, impacting\ntravel.\n\nWind chill values are expected to be in the teens late Tuesday\nnight and Wednesday morning, with brisk north winds. Low wind\nchills could cause frostbite. Dress in layers and cover your head\nif you plan on being outside.\n\nResidents across West Central Texas should continue to monitor\nthe latest forecasts and updates regarding this developing winter\nweather system.",
