In northeast Georgia...Towns and\nWhite. In northwest Georgia...Bartow...Catoosa...Chattooga...\nDade...Floyd...Gordon...Murray...Polk...Walker and Whitfield.\n\n* Until 1 PM EST this afternoon\n\n* A cold front will move southeast across the forecast area today.\nThis front will bring another round of locally heavy rainfall to\nmuch of north Georgia. Rainfall amounts of one to two inches\nwill be possible, with locally higher amounts possible. Soils\nremain saturated and several rivers, creeks and streams remain\nnear or in flood, so any additional rainfall will only create\nrun off and exacerbate ongoing flooding conditions.\n\n* Flash flooding and minor to moderate flooding of larger creeks\nand rivers is expected. This will close some roads and could\nflood homes and businesses in flood-prone areas. Along larger\ncreeks and rivers, flooding could last for several days.",
