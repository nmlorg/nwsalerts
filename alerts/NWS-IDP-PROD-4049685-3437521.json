        "description": "...HEAVY SNOW EXPECTED ACROSS CENTRAL AND EAST-CENTRAL WISCONSIN\nTODAY...\n\n.A low pressure system located over extreme northwest Iowa at\ndaybreak will track to northeast Iowa by noon, then along the\nWisconsin/Illinois border this afternoon. This is a rather compact\nbut vigorous storm system, and will bring a significant snowfall\nto all but far northern Wisconsin. The storm is also fast moving,\nso snow will quickly overspread the area during the morning, but\nalso diminish quickly from west to east during the late afternoon\nand evening.\n\nAlthough winds are not expected to be strong during the storm,\nthe heavy snowfall could reduce the visibility to under 1/4 mile\nat times, especially in central and east-central Wisconsin. This\nwill likely result in hazardous travel conditions. Air travel is\nalso likely to be affected by the storm.\n\n* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 3 to 6\ninches, with slightly lower totals north of Rhinelander.\n\n* WHERE...Langlade, Lincoln, Forest and Oneida Counties.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel will become hazardous.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow is expected to develop by 1000 am,\nand the intensity of the snow will increase quickly. This will\nresult in rapidly deteriorating travel conditions during\nmorning.",
        "instruction": "If traveling today, expect to encounter roads that are snow\ncovered and slippery, and allow plenty of time to reach your\ndestination. The latest road conditions can be obtained by\ncalling 5 1 1.",
