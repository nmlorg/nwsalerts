The Lakeshore Flood Watch is no longer in\neffect.\n\n* WHAT...Significant lakeshore flooding is expected. Strong north\nto north-northwest winds of 25 to 30 mph with gusts up to 35 to\n40 mph will build waves to 10 to 14 feet with occasional waves\nup to 18 feet.\n\n* WHERE...Shoreline areas of Lake and Porter Counties in Indiana.\n\n* WHEN...Thursday morning through Thursday evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...The winds and large battering waves combined with\nrecord high lake levels could exacerbate already significant\nbeach and shoreline erosion sustained in the past several\nmonths. Vulnerable structures along the shore may be heavily\ndamaged. The water will likely threaten some roads near the\nlake, including Lakefront Drive in the Beverly Shores area of\nPorter County. In addition, low lying and flood prone areas\nincluding Whiting Lakefront Park will also likely be impacted.\nLarge waves may sweep onlookers into the lake.",
