The core of heaviest precipitation occurred\nwithin 50 miles north and south of Interstate 70 across the state.\nThe bulk of the water will show up in the White River south of\nIndianapolis, where crests are expected to be up to about 5 feet\nabove flood stage.  Flooding along the lower reaches of the Wabash\nand White Rivers currently are predicted to last until the end of\nnext week.\n\nThe latest forecast model data is now predicting flood crests along\nthe White River to be lower than what was predicted Monday morning.\nThis will give us crests lower than what we saw in January.\nPredictions for the Wabash are very similiar to Monday's\npredictions.\n\nFlood impacts should mainly be confined to roads near the waterways,\nagricultural land, bottomlands, and levees.  Please see the specific\nimpacts listed for your location of interest below or by going to\nthe web page described below.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe Wabash River at Riverton.\n* until Thursday February 20.\n* At 11:00 AM Tuesday the stage was 15.4 feet.\n* Flood stage is 15.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will rise to near 17.3 feet by Sunday afternoon then\nbegin falling. It will fall below flood stage Thursday February 20.\n* At 18.0 feet...Extensive lowland flooding is in progress.  High\nwater surrounds many river cabins.  Access to most river cabins is\nby boat only.  Levees begin to protect farmland.  Extensive\nflooding of Leaverton Park occurs in Palestine, Illinois.",
        "instruction": "Precautionary/Preparedness Actions...\n\nMotorists should never drive into flood water. Turn around and go\nanother way. Keep children away from flooded areas.
