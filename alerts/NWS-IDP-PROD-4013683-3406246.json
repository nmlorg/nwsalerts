        "description": "...Periods of heavy rainfall through early morning...\n\n.Additional showers are expected this morning, some moderate to\nheavy at times. With persistent rain over the last week, creeks\nand streams are already elevated. This additional rainfall will\nlikely result in some small streams and creeks overtopping their\nbanks on the coastal plain. Localized urban flooding will also be\npossible. Farther inland, snow will continue in the mountains\nresulting in a lower threat of flooding.\n\nThe Flood Watch continues for\n\n* A portion of northwest California, including the following\nareas, Coastal Del Norte and Northern Humboldt Coast.\n\n* Until noon today.\n\n* One to two inches of rain is expected on top of saturated\nsoils. This will result in rising small streams and creeks\nwith some overtopping their banks. Localized urban flooding\nwill also be possible. Main stem river flooding is not\nexpected.\n\n* Some creeks and streams that may flood include Jacoby Creek,\nElk River, Freshwater Creek, Coffee Creek, Hookton Slough,\nMartin Slough, and other low-lying areas. Some roads that may\nbe impacted in Humboldt County include Berta Road, Coffee\nCreek Road, Hookton Road, Howard Heights Road, Myrtle Avenue,\nOld Arcata Road, and Graham Road. Lake Earl Drive near the\nSmith River, Fred D Haight Drive, and other low lying areas\nmay see flooding in Del Norte County.",
        "instruction": "A Flood Watch means there is a potential for flooding based on\ncurrent forecasts.\n\nYou should monitor later forecasts and be alert for possible\nFlood Warnings. Those living in areas prone to flooding should be\nprepared to take action should flooding develop.",
