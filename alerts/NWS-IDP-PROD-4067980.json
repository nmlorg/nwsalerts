        "description": "Rain will continue to overspread the area through the day today.\nAs colder air filters into north Georgia through this afternoon,\na transition to a mixture of rain and snow is possible. During the\nafternoon hours, this mixture could briefly change to all snow\nbefore quickly ending by mid-to-late afternoon.\n\nAccumulations are expected to remain limited, generally a half\ninch or less, though amounts up to an inch are possible at the\nhighest elevations of Dade and Walker counties. Also of concern is\nthe fact that temperatures will drop quickly Thursday night into\nFriday morning. Any lingering moisture on the roadways during this\ntimeframe will result in black ice which could create additional\nhazardous driving conditions.",
