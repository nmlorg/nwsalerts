These bands\nhave been most intense between Hana and Keanae with rain rates of\n1 to 2 inches per hour. Stream levels in the area are running\nhigher than normal. Additional rain bands are expected to move\nover windward Haleakala through today.\n\n* Locations in the advisory include but are not limited to...\nHaiku-Pauwela, Huelo, Pauwela, Kipahulu, Makawao, Nahiku, Hana,\nKailua and Haleakala National Park.",

Turn around, don't drown.",
