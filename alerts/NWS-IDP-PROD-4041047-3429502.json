In central South\nCarolina, Aiken, Chesterfield, Edgefield, Fairfield, Kershaw,\nLexington, McCormick, Newberry, Northern Lancaster, Richland,\nSaluda, and Southern Lancaster.\n\n* From 7 AM EST this morning through late tonight\n\n* Soils remain saturated from the recent wet period. Rainfall\ntotals from 2 to 3 inches are expected through tonight. Locally\nhigher amounts may occur leading to flash flooding.\n\n* Rapid rises are expected on streams and creeks. Additionally,\nwater will quickly pond in areas of poor-drainage. This will\nlead to the threat of roadways becoming flooded, especially this\nafternoon and evening.",
        "instruction": "A Flash Flood Watch means that conditions may develop that lead\nto flash flooding. Flash flooding is a VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.\n\nDo not attempt to drive on flooded roads. It takes little water\nto move a vehicle off the road and into deeper water. On foot,\nkeep away from storm drains.\n\nOwners of small ponds should monitor pond levels and dam\nintegrity.",
