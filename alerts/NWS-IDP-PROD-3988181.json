        "description": "As a cold front approaches from the west overnight, scattered\nlight wintry precipitation may accompany the front with its\npassage. Some uncertainty with the amount of warm air ahead of\nthe front will mean a variety of precipitation types is possible,\nincluding freezing rain, sleet and snow showers, for east central\nMinnesota into western Wisconsin, including all of the Twin Cities\nmetro area. Temperatures will rise overnight but ground\ntemperatures will lag behind, meaning that a light glazing of ice\nis possible, especially on untreated and elevated surfaces such as\nsidewalks, bridges and overpasses. The timing of the potential icy\nprecipitation looks to be roughly between 300 AM and 700 AM\nSunday morning. If planning to travel during the early to mid\nmorning hours Sunday morning, be advised to use extra caution as\ntravel may briefly be hazardous.",
