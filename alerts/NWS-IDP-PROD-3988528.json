        "description": "A stalled out frontal boundary will provide a focus for showers\nand some thunderstorms with heavy rainfall Thursday, Friday and\npossibly through Saturday. The 3 to 5 inches of rainfall currently\nforecast represents a conservative estimate. The potential exists\nfor a narrower swath of 6 inches or more somewhere across the four\nstate region. The heaviest rains are likely Friday into Saturday.\n\nWith nearly saturated ground conditions expected at the beginning\nof the event, flooding problems are likely to develop rather\nquickly. At the very least, flooding of low-lying and poorly\ndrained areas, as well as low water crossings, can be expected.\nWhere the heaviest rains occur more significant flooding problems\nmay develop.\n\nWater levels are already high on the Ohio River and some of its\ntributaries, and the additional rainfall could lead to delayed\ncrests or higher crest levels. In addition, new river flooding\nwill be possible throughout the area.\n\nPlease stay tuned to the latest forecasts of this potentially\nsignificant heavy rainfall and flooding event.",
