In northeast Georgia...Towns and\nWhite. In northwest Georgia...Bartow...Catoosa...Chattooga...\nDade...Floyd...Gordon...Murray...Polk...Walker and Whitfield.\n\n* Through Thursday afternoon\n\n* A cold front will push into Georgia tonight and continue moving\nsoutheast through Thursday. This front will bring another round\nof locally heavy rainfall to much of north Georgia. Rainfall\namounts of one to two inches will be likely, with locally higher\namounts possible. Soils remain saturated and several rivers,\ncreeks and streams remain near or in flood, so any additional\nrainfall will only create run off and exacerbate ongoing\nflooding conditions.\n\n* Flash flooding and minor to moderate flooding of larger creeks\nand rivers is expected. This will close some roads and could\nflood homes and businesses in flood-prone areas. Along larger\ncreeks and rivers, flooding could last for several days.",
