Although the rain\nwill gradually end from the west through late morning, rises\ncontinue along streams and creeks around the Advised area. Radar\nand rain gauge data indicate that 2 to 3 inches of rain fell\novernight, and additional rainfall of one-half to one inch is\npossible before the precipitation tapers off. This will likely\nproduce minor flooding of low-lying and poor drainage areas near\nthe streams.\n\n* Some locations that may experience flooding include...\nBryson City, Robbinsville, Town Of Santeetlah, the Fontana Lake\nArea, the Santeetlah area, and the vicinity of Deep Creek. Sharp\nrises to bankfull are expected along the Cheoah River near Tapoco\nand Tulula Creek near Robbinsville. Flooding is also possible\nalong streams along and near the Tuckasegee River near Bryson City.",
        "instruction": "Turn around, don't drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood\ndeaths occur in vehicles. Be especially cautious at night when it is\nharder to recognize the dangers of flooding.\n\nOnly when it is safe to do so, please report floodwaters or\nlandslides flowing over roads or threatening property to the National\nWeather Service by calling toll-free, 1, 800, 2 6 7, 8 1 0 1, by\nposting on our Facebook page, or via Twitter using hashtag NWSGSP.\nYour message should describe the event and the specific location\nwhere it occurred, including roadways, nearby cross streets, stream\nnames, and other landmarks.",
