Behind the front warm air will surge north into the\nInterior as strong Chinook winds develop across the Alaska Range.\n\nAs the temperatures rise there is a high potential for frost to\ndevelop on the cold soaked roads of the Interior making traveling\nconditions difficult at times.\n\nFor the latest Interior forecasts go to www.weather.gov/fairbanks.",
