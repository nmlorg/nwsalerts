Storm-total rainfall amounts of 2-4 inches occurred\nacross most of Greenwood County, with an area of 3-4.5 inches\nobserved generally along a line from Bradley to Ninety-Six.\n\n* Several roads remain closed, including:\nHunter Rd at County Line Rd;\nBethel Rd near Jordan Rd;\nDendy Bridge Rd near Indian Rd;\nWarner Rd at Old Hastings Rd;\nTillman Territory Rd at Kinard Rd;\nPaysinger Rd at Hwy 248;\nMcKenzie Rd;\nand Tedards Store Rd;\n\n* Please obey all barricades, even where water isn't covering the\nroadway.  Roads and bridges must be inspected by engineers\nfollowing flooding to ensure they were not compromised and\nbarricades are in place for your safety.\n\n* Only light showers are expected through this afternoon and early\nevening; however, since several roads will remain flooded for several\nmore hours, a Flood Advisory has replaced the Flood Warning and\nwill remain in effect through this evening.\n\n* Additional rounds of rainfall are expected tonight through early\ntomorrow morning which may exacerbate residual flooding or cause\nnew flooding to develop. People in the Greenwood County area are\nadvised to stay weather aware.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flood impacts include...\nNinety Six, Troy, Lake Greenwood State Park, Greenwood State Park,\nNinety Six Historic Site, Promised Land, Bradley, Kirksey, Dyson\nand Callison.",
