The heaviest snow fell over Rabbit Ears Pass and to the\nnorth, while parts of Summit County weren't too far behind. More\nsnow is expected this morning before the storm begins moving out\nof the state.  Gusty winds of 35 to 50 mph can also be expected\non mountain passes, with even higher winds in backcountry areas.\nThe winds will produce blowing and drifting snow with reduced\nvisibilities. Additional accumulations should be less than 4 to 6\ninches, but travel conditions will still be hazardous due to the\ncombination of snow that fell overnight and anticipated additional\nsnowfall.\n\n* WHAT...Snow with additional snow accumulations of 2 to 5 inches.\nWinds gusting up to 50 to 60 mph.\n\n* WHERE...The Mountains of Summit County, the Mosquito Range,\nand the Indian Peaks and Rocky Mountain National Park and the\nMedicine Bow Range.\n\n* WHEN...Until noon MST today.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions, especially this morning.\nAreas of blowing snow could significantly reduce visibility.",
