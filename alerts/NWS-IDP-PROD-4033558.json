This will allow for patchy ice to form on some\nsurfaces, leading to slick travel. Those traveling along I-77\nthrough Fancy Gap, Virginia, and across the North Carolina High\nCountry into southern Virginia on the Parkway and other roads at\nhigher elevations should be alert for a few slick spots, and\nrestricted visibilities. Slow down and allow for more time to\nreach your destination.",
