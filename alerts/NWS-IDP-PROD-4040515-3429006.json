In Virginia, Amherst, Appomattox, Bedford, Buckingham,\nCampbell, Carroll, Charlotte, Floyd, Franklin, Grayson,\nHalifax, Henry, Patrick, and Pittsylvania.\n\n* Through Friday morning.\n\n* An extended period of rainfall with high rainfall rates and\nthunderstorms on Thursday create favorable conditions for\nflooding. Rainfall totals of 3 to 4 inches with locally higher\namounts over 5 inches possible along the Blue Ridge.\n\n* The ground will be saturated when thunderstorms are most\nlikely. High rainfall rates inside of these storms could\npotentially create rapid water rises, especially in small\ncreeks and streams, areas with poor drainage, and low lying\nareas.",
