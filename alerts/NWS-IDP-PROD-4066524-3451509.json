For the Freezing\nSpray Advisory, light accumulation of freezing spray expected.\n\n* WHERE...Coastal Waters from Eastport, ME to Schoodic Point, ME\nout 25 NM and Coastal Waters from Schoodic Point, ME to\nStonington, ME out 25 NM.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, from 9 AM this morning to 7 PM\nEST this evening. For the Freezing Spray Advisory, from 1 AM\nto 1 PM EST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in freezing spray is hazardous.\nFreezing spray may render mechanical and electronic components\ninoperative. Ice accretion on decks and superstructures may\nresult in some loss of stability. Strong winds will cause\nhazardous seas which could capsize or damage vessels and reduce\nvisibility.",
