The crest on the\nEast Fork White River is in the Columbus and Seymour areas.  Flooding\non the Wabash and and White Rivers will last into at least late next\nweek.  Flooding on the East Fork White River will last until probably\nlate Monday or early Tuesday next week.\n\nLittle or no precipitation is in the forecast through Wednesday, thus\narea waterways will be able to continue their movement to normal\nlevels.\n\nThe Flood Warning continues for\nThe White River at Anderson.\n* until Tuesday afternoon.\n* At  5:30 PM Sunday the stage was 12.8 feet.\n* Flood stage is 10.0 feet.\n* Minor flooding is occurring and Minor flooding is forecast.\n* Forecast...It will continue to fall to below flood stage by late\nMonday night.\n* At 13.0 feet...Flood waters close Edgewood Park and Grand Avenue\nbetween Alexandria Pike and Broadway.
