        "description": "Across the far northern tier including Dade, Walker, Catoosa, and\nWhitfield, a transition to a mix of rain and snow remains possible\nbefore the precipitation exits late this afternoon. Initially\ntemperatures will be too warm for any accumulations except the\nhighest peaks where a dusting to up to a half an inch is possible.\n\nColder air will rush in behind the precipitation with temperatures\ndropping below freezing shortly after midnight for the far\nnorthern sections and the Atlanta metro sections a few hours\nlater. Winds will aid in drying roads but any residual water on\narea roadways could result in black ice. With the abundant\nrainfall over the last few weeks, there will be a higher than\nnormal chance of black ice conditions especially where water flows\nthrough the higher elevations and across roadways. This will\ncreate hazardous driving conditions where it does occur through\nthe rush hour Friday morning. Temperatures are expected to rise\nabove freezing after 10AM for most areas.\n\nFinally, there are a few weather model solutions that suggest some\nlight snow is possible overnight in the Atlanta metro due to cold\nair rushing over the warmer Lake Lanier. There is low chance of\nthis occurring and any accumulations if at all would be very\nlight.",
