        "description": "A brief period of light snow or flurries will continue over the\nMaryland eastern shore and Accomack county VA through mid-\nmorning...mainly along and east of highway 13.\n\nDry air at the surface will keep much of the precip aloft from\nmaking it to the surface...but a few snow flakes may fall in\nareas where precip intensity is enough to overcome the dry air.\nImpacts to travel will be minimal but drivers should be aware of\nthe potential for a few slick spots as ground temperatures remain\nnear to slightly below freezing.",
