        "description": "A strong Pacific storm system is forecast to move into the\nnorthern Rockies Sunday, bringing a variety of winter weather\nhazards for Sunday and Monday. First, snow is expected to begin\nacross the Central Mountains Sunday morning, spreading southeast\ninto the Arco Desert and eastern Magic Valley area by Sunday\nafternoon. The snow may briefly mix with rain in the eastern Magic\nValley before temperatures cool. Snow will continue into Monday\nmorning, accumulating 2 to 5 inches across the Central Mountains\nwith locally up to 8 inches above pass level, 1 to 3 inches in\nthe Wood River Valley, Lincoln County, and the eastern Magic\nValley. Second, a strong cold front will blast across the region\nSunday afternoon and evening. If roads are wet, rapidly falling\ntemperatures behind the front may result in a flash freeze,\nresulting in icy roads, especially if they are untreated. Finally,\nsouthwest winds of 10 to 15 MPH gusting to 35 MPH are expected\nSunday afternoon across the eastern Magic Valley to Arco Desert,\nshifting into the northwest at 15 to 20 MPH gusting to 35 MPH\nMonday. Winds across the Central Mountains will largely be out of\nthe north to northwest at similar speeds at higher elevations, a\nbit lower in the valleys. Winds of this magnitude may result in\nareas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nThe combination of a possible flash freeze, moderate snow, and\nblowing and drifting snow may result in hazardous travel\nconditions across the region, especially from Sunday evening\nthrough Monday evening. Snow covered and icy roads and reduced\nvisibilities are possible.\n\nStay tuned to the latest updates and possible watches, warnings,\nand advisories from the National Weather Service.",
