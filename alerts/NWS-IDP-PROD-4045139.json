Immediately following that cold front, sustained\nsouthwesterly winds of 20 to 40 mph, with frequent gusts between\n40 and 50 mph, can be expected. Infrequent gusts in excess of 50\nmph will be possible. In fact, a 53 mph gust was recently measured\nat Piedmont Triad Airport. These winds will result in significant\ntree damage, including falling trees and tree branches. Uprooted\ntrees will also result due to saturated soil. Power outages will\nbecome numerous to possibly widespread. The wind will lessen and\nbecome less hazardous by noon, but remain breezy through sunset.\n\nTravel and outdoor activities are very strongly discouraged this\nmorning.",
