Second Creek continues to rise following\nearlier rainfall. Minor flooding is occurring along Bat Creek. Two\nto three inches of rain have fallen already since Wednesday, and\nsoils are saturated to the point that new flooding may develop\nquickly with additional heavy rainfall.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nSalisbury, China Grove, Spencer, Landis, Enochville, Granite\nQuarry, Rockwell, Cleveland, Faith and Mount Ulla.",
        "instruction": "Most flood deaths occur in vehicles. Do not attempt to cross\nwater-covered roadways, bridges, or low-level crossings. Only a few\ninches of rapidly flowing water can carry away your vehicle. It is\nnot worth the risk. Please TURN AROUND, DON'T DROWN.\n\nExcessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of small\ncreeks and streams, highways, and underpasses. Addditionally, country\nroads and farmlands along the banks of creeks, streams, and other\nlow-lying areas are subject to flooding.\n\nOnly when it is safe to do so, please report floodwaters or\nlandslides flowing over roads or threatening property to the National\nWeather Service by calling toll-free, 1, 800, 2 6 7, 8 1 0 1, by\nposting on our Facebook page, or via Twitter using hashtag NWSGSP.\nYour message should describe the event and the specific location\nwhere it occurred, including roadways, nearby cross streets, stream\nnames and other landmarks.",
