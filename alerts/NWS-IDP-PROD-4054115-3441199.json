In west central Alabama, Fayette, Greene,\nHale, Lamar, Pickens, Sumter, and Tuscaloosa.\n\n* From Wednesday afternoon through Thursday Morning\n\n* Heavy rainfall with showers and thunderstorms will move into\nCentral Alabama Wednesday night through Thursday morning\nassociated with a cold front. An additional 1 to 1.5 inches of\nrainfall with isolated higher amounts are forecast, which may\nfall in a short period of time. Due to very saturated soil\nconditions and areal flooding still ongoing, flash flooding will\nbe possible once again.\n\n* Any heavy rainfall amounts in a short period of time will\ngreatly enhance the risk of flash flooding due to already\nsaturated soil conditions and rapid water runoff.",
