For the Small Craft Advisory,\nnorthwest winds 15 to 25 kt with gusts up to 30 kt and waves 4\nto 7 feet.\n\n* WHERE...Sheboygan to Port Washington WI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 3 AM\nThursday to midnight CST Thursday night. For the Small Craft\nAdvisory, until 6 PM CST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Conditions will be hazardous to small craft.",
