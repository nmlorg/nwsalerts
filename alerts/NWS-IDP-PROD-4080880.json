For other locations across the mid state, at least 2 to 3\ninches of rainfall accumulation during this time frame is\nexpected.\n\nThese forecast rainfall amounts, combined with already saturated\nground conditions, will likely lead to flooding along rivers,\ncreeks, streams, roadways, low lying areas, and other poor\ndrainage locations as well as flash flooding.",
