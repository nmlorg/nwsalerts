Due to saturated soils from previous rainfall,\nthis slow moving band of thunderstorms is expected to result in\nsignificant ponding of water on roads and flooding. Up to two\ninches of rain have already fallen, with additional rainfall\namounts of two to three inches per hour anticipated within the\nline of thunderstorms.\n\n* Some locations that will experience flooding include...\nHuntsville, Decatur, Madison, Athens, Hartselle, Winchester,\nFayetteville, Moores Mill, Meridianville and Lynchburg.",
