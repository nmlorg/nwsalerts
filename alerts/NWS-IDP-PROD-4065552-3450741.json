Heavy freezing spray at a rate\nof 2 cm per hour or greater expected, and may rapidly\naccumulate on vessels.\n\n* WHERE...Lake Superior from Grand Marais MI to Whitefish Point\nMI 5NM off shore to the US/Canadian border, Lake Superior East\nof a line from Manitou Island to Marquette MI and West of a\nline from Grand Marais MI to the US/Canadian Border Beyond 5NM\nfrom shore, Marquette to Munising MI, Munising to Grand Marais\nMI and Grand Marais to Whitefish Point MI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Gale Warning, until 1 AM EST Wednesday. For the\nHeavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 4 PM this afternoon to 10\nPM EST Wednesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
        "instruction": "Mariners should prepare for dangerous accumulation of ice on\ntheir vessel. If possible, remain in port, avoid the warning area\nor conduct mitigation.\n\nMariners should alter plans to avoid these hazardous conditions.\nRemain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or secure the\nvessel for severe conditions.",
