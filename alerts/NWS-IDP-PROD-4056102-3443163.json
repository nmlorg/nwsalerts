Strong northwest winds and\nlight snow immediately behind the front have lead to areas of\nblowing snow over northern Iowa, including near blizzard\nconditions at times in northwest Iowa where recent snowfall has\noccurred. Rapidly falling temperatures also accompany the front\nwhich could lead to a flash freeze of wet or slushy roads,\nparticularly in portions of south central into southeastern Iowa\nwhere accumulating snowfall has occurred today.\n\nBitter cold temperatures and breezy winds combine to drop wind\nchill values to dangerously cold levels late Wednesday night into\nThursday morning.\n\n* WHAT...Very cold wind chills expected. Wind chills as low as\n30 below zero.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of central and south central Iowa.\n\n* WHEN...From midnight tonight to noon Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...The cold wind chills could cause frostbite on\nexposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures will plummet and it is\npossible that wet or slushy roads could flash freeze, creating\nicy spots on roadways Wednesday evening.",
