        "description": "* Today: Wind and a little bit of snow. Main wind impacts to\ntravel around Lake Tahoe, and along Highway 395 including Washoe\nValley and Mono County. Light snow impacts over Sierra,\nnortheast California passes.\n\n* Sunday Afternoon-Monday: More wind and another round of light\nsnow showers. Wind impacts focused in mountains and along\nHighway 395. Light snow showers affecting Sierra passes.\n\n* Monday Evening-Tuesday: A lot of wind and heavier snow.\nWidespread wind impacts including potential for localized\ndamage, power outages. Burst of heavy snow causing disruptions\nfor Sierra travel. Possible brief snow for Tuesday morning\ncommute in western Nevada cities but less certain.\n\n* Wednesday Evening-Thursday: A lot of snow and probably more\nwind. Strongest storm in the sequence and also colder leading to\nincreased heavy snow and whiteout potential in the Sierra and\nnortheast California. Strong wind impacts with a more prolonged\nperiod of snow for western Nevada cities. This scenario would be\nquite disruptive for travel and be the largest storm of the\nwinter season thus far.\n\n* Anyone with road or air travel plans over the coming week should\nkeep a close eye on the forecast. Disruptions and delays are a\ngood bet from these storms. At this point Sunday, Wednesday,\nand Friday are looking decent for travel. For road condition\ninformation check with NDOT or Caltrans or your favorite mapping\napp.",
