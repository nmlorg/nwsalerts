The\ntail end of the morning commute may be impacted. Conditions should\nimprove by the evening commute with precipitation ending and\ntemperatures a degree or two above freezing.\n\nIce accumulation will be light, less than a tenth of an inch.\nHowever, any amount of ice can create very hazardous conditions.\nThe patchy nature of this precipitation could leave some icy\nspots on roads, bridges, and sidewalks, with other areas remaining\ndry. Expect the possibility of hazardous conditions at any time,\neven if it is not currently precipitating.",
