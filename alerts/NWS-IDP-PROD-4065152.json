        "description": "Storm force winds of at least 48kts will continue to threaten the\ncoastal waters extending 40 nautical mile from Manua through\nTuesday, as a complex environment within the active monsoon\ntrough keeps the possibility of a tropical cyclone developing over\nor near the islands. Seas of 20 to 25 feet or higher will remain\nthrough Tuesday, with higher seas near thunderstorms.\n\nA storm warning means sustained winds of 48-63 kts (55-73 mph) or\ngreater, is either predicted or occurring, and not directly\nassociated with a tropical cyclone.\n\nStorm force winds and dangerous seas could capsize or damage\nvessels and the frequent showers could reduce visibility.\n\nMariners should consider altering plans to avoid possible hazardous\nconditions. Remain in port, seek safe harbor, alter course, and/or\nsecure the vessel for severe wind and seas.\n\nListen to NOAA Weather Radio for the latest updates.\n\nYou may also follow us on Facebook \"NWSPagoPago\" or our website\nat www.weather.gov/ppg.",
