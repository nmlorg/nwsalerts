        "description": "An arctic cold front was dropping south across central into far\nnortheast Wisconsin early this evening, bringing a round of light\nsnow. Most locations should see an inch or two of snow before\ntapering off to scattered flurries later this evening or on early\nThursday morning. The combination of the falling snow, along with\nmelting snow on pavement surfaces and falling air temperatures\nwell below freezing could lead to a flash freeze this evening.\nGusty northerly winds may also create some areas of blowing and\ndrifting snow.\n\nOvernight, temperatures are expected to fall to 5 below to 5 above\nzero. The combination of the cold temperatures and gusty northerly\nwinds will produce wind chill readings in the 10 below to 20\nbelow zero range late tonight into Thursday morning. Wind chill\nreadings this low can produce frost bite in 30 minutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving this evening as\nroads will be slippery due to ice and snow. If venturing outdoors\novernight, wear layers of clothing along with a hat and gloves to\nprotect yourself from the cold.",
