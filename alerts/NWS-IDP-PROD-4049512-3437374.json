        "description": "...HEAVY SNOW EXPECTED ACROSS CENTRAL AND EAST-CENTRAL WISCONSIN\nTODAY...\n\n.A low pressure system located over extreme southeast South Dakota\nearly this morning will track to northeast Iowa by noon, then\nalong the Wisconsin/Illinois border this afternoon. This is a\nrather compact but vigorous storm system, and will bring a\nsignificant snowfall to all but far northern Wisconsin. The storm\nis also fast moving, so snow will quickly overspread the area\nduring the morning, but also diminish quickly from west to east\nduring the late afternoon and evening.\n\nAlthough winds are not expected to be strong during the storm, the\nheavy snowfall could reduce the visibility to under 1/4 mile at\ntimes, especially in central and east-central Wisconsin. This will\nlikely result in hazardous travel conditions. Air travel is also\nlikely to be affected by the storm.\n\n* WHAT...Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 6 to 10\ninches.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of central and northeast Wisconsin.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Travel will become difficult due to snow covered roads\nand greatly reduced visibility in the heavy snow.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Snow is expected to develop between 600 am\nand 900 am, and will quickly become heavy. The rapid onset of\nheavy snow is likely to result in very rapidly deteriorating\ntravel conditions during the morning.",
        "instruction": "If traveling during the storm, expect to drive at a much slower\nthan normal speed and allow plenty of time to reach your\ndestination. Be sure to take some food and water along with you in\nyour vehicle in case of an emergency. The latest road conditions\ncan be obtained by calling 5 1 1.",
