        "description": "A light wintry mix remains possible over portions of the Quad\nState region early this morning.\n\nTemperatures will be in the lower and middle 30s through 9 am\nCST, as pockets of precipitation slowly move from west to east.\n\nAt this time, any accumulations of snow, sleet, or freezing rain\nare expected to be extremely isolated and should not pose a\nsignificant travel concern.\n\nRegardless, drivers should still be watchful for any slick spots\non elevated road surfaces, such as bridges, through the morning\ncommute.\n\nThe best chance for seeing any wintry mix will be along and west\nof the Mississippi River in southeast Missouri, and in southern\nIllinois, along and west of Interstate 57.\n\nAccording to the Missouri Department of Transportation, some roads\nover parts of southeast Missouri were partially covered with a\nwintry mix overnight. Drivers heading out this morning in\nsoutheast Missouri should exercise caution and allow extra time to\nreach their destination.\n\nTemperatures are expected to gradually warm as the morning\nprogresses, so any wintry mix should turn back to rain by the\nmiddle of the morning, lessening any further travel concerns.",
