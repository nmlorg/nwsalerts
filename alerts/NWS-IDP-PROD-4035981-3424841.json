For the Hard Freeze Watches, sub-\nfreezing temperatures in the teens will be possible.\n\n* WHERE...Antelope Valley.\n\n* WHEN...For the High Wind Warning, until noon PST Monday. For\nthe first Hard Freeze Watch, from Monday evening through\nTuesday morning. For the second Hard Freeze Watch, from\nTuesday evening through Wednesday morning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Damaging winds will blow down large objects such as\ntrees and power lines. Power outages are likely. Areas of\nblowing dust and sand could reduce visibilities locally under\none quarter mile or less. High profile vehicles, including big\nrigs could be blown over by the powerful winds. This will\nlikely be the coldest nights we have seen so far this season.\nHard freeze conditions could kill crops, other sensitive\nvegetation and cause unprotected pipes to burst.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Strongest winds tonight across western\nportions of the Antelope Valley. Major roadways that could be\nimpacted by the powerful winds and wind damage include\nHighways 14 and 138.",
        "instruction": "People should avoid being outside in forested areas and around\ntrees and branches. If possible, remain in the lower levels of\nyour home during the windstorm, and avoid windows. Use caution if\nyou must drive.\n\nTake steps now to protect tender plants from the cold. To prevent\nfreezing and possible bursting of outdoor water pipes they should\nbe wrapped, drained, or allowed to drip slowly. Those that have\nin-ground sprinkler systems should drain them and cover above-\nground pipes to protect them from freezing.",
