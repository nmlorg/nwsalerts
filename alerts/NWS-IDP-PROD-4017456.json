Surface temperatures will start off near or\nslightly below freezing before rising past midnight. Cold surface\ntemperatures may allow for brief slick spots on area roadways and\nelevated surfaces before temperatures warm sufficiently in the\npredawn hours on Saturday morning.\n\nOnly light snow and ice accumulations are possible, but those\ntraveling are urged to exercise caution late this evening into the\nearly overnight hours. A transition to all rain by daybreak\nshould allow for any slick spots to melt early Saturday morning.",
