In some locations\nthis could result in freeze up ice jam formation and localized\nflooding. Freeze up type ice jams are typically short lived but\ncan result in rapid water rises.\n\nThose living near waterways should pay close attention to the\nstate of the river ice, move livestock and equipment away from\nlow lying areas, and be prepared to seek higher ground should\nwaters rise.\n\nIf ice jam flooding does develop please report it to local law\nenforcement, and have them pass it on to the National Weather\nService.",
