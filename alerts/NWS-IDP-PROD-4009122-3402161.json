This boundary\nwill focus the development of several clusters of showers and\nthunderstorms, which could produce locally heavy rainfall rates\ndue to the high amount of moisture in the atmosphere. Given moist\nsoil conditions in place across the region, flash flooding will be\na concern, especially in portions of the Tennessee Valley that\nreceive several consecutive rounds of heavy precipitation.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Huntsville has issued a\n\n* Flash Flood Watch for all counties in northern Alabama as well\nas Franklin, Lincoln, and Moore counties in southern Tennessee.\n\n* Through 6 AM CST Wednesday.\n\n* Multiple episodes of showers and thunderstorms producing heavy\nrainfall will occur across the region through Wednesday morning.\nDue to moist soil conditions, this will result in efficient\nrunoff and the potential for rapidly rising and swiftly flowing\nflood waters.",
