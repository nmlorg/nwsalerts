This will likely result\nin significant beach erosion, overwash onto vulnerable low-lying\ncoastal roadways, and surges within north and west facing harbors\nsuch as Haleiwa and Waianae.\n\n* WHAT...Surf will be 20 to 30 feet along north and west facing\nshores of Niihau and Kauai, as well as north facing shores of\nOahu, Molokai, and Maui. Surf will be 12 to 20 feet along west\nfacing shores of Oahu and Molokai.\n\n* WHERE...North and west facing shores of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu,\nMolokai, and north facing shores of Maui.\n\n* WHEN...Through 6 AM HST Tuesday.\n\n* IMPACTS...High. Expect ocean water occasionally sweeping\nacross portions of beaches, very strong breaking waves, and\nstrong longshore and rip currents. Breaking waves may\noccasionally impact harbors making navigating the harbor\nchannel dangerous.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...The combination of strong onshore winds,\nlarge surf, and peak monthly tides will likely cause significant\nbeach erosion, flooding of beaches that normally remain dry and\noverwash onto vulnerable low-lying coastal roads and other\ncoastal infrastructure.",
