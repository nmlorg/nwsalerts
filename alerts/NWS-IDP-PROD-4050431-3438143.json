At 147 PM PST, Doppler radar continued to indicate areas of\nmoderate to locally heavy showers extending along the Interstate 210\ncorridor from Monrovia to Pasadena and Glendale, as well as Hollywood\nto Beverly Hills. There have been several reports of roadway flooding\nacross portions of the Los Angeles basin, especially near the foothills.\n\n* Isolated thunderstorms are still possible across this region, potentially\nbringing brief heavy downpours, small hail, and gusty winds. Rainfall\nrates will generally range between 0.25 and  0.50 inches per hour with\nheavier showers, but an isolated rate to near 1.00 inch per hour will\nbe possible near any thunderstorms that develop.\n\n* Some locations that could experience roadway flooding include...\nSierra Madre, Pasadena, Glendale, Altadena, Hollywood and\nBeverly Hills. Major roadways that could be impacted include Interstates\n5, 210, and 405 as well as Highways 2 and 134.",
