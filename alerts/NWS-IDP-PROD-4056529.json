        "description": "The arctic cold front will front will move across the area by 8\npm, bringing a round of light snow. Most locations should see an\ninch or two of snow before tapering off to scattered flurries\nlater this evening or on early Thursday morning. The combination\nof the falling snow, along with melting snow on pavement surfaces\nand falling air temperatures well below freezing could lead to a\nflash freeze this evening. Gusty northerly winds may also create\nsome areas of blowing and drifting snow.\n\nOvernight, temperatures are expected to fall to 5 below to 5 above\nzero. The combination of the cold temperatures and gusty northerly\nwinds will produce wind chill readings in the 10 below to 20\nbelow zero range late tonight into Thursday morning. Wind chill\nreadings this low can produce frost bite in 30 minutes.\n\nAllow extra travel time if you will be driving this evening as\nroads will be slippery due to ice and snow. If venturing outdoors\novernight, wear layers of clothing along with a hat and gloves to\nprotect yourself from the cold.",
