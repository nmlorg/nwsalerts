Some additional light snow accumulations of less than one\ninch are possible. A flash freeze of wet roadways and other\nsurfaces is likely overnight, as much colder air surges\nsouthward. Strong and gusty north winds around 40 mph will also\naccompany the cold air.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of central, south central, and southeast\nKansas.\n\n* WHEN...Through the late evening hours.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions especially for\nuntreated surfaces tonight as colder air spreads southward.\nThis could cause a refreeze of wet and slushy roads tonight,\npossibly impacting the Thursday morning commute. In addition,\nthe very cold air will combine with strong north winds to\ncreate sub zero wind chills for late tonight and early\nThursday morning.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...Temperatures will fall below freezing by\nmidnight and into teens by Thursday morning.",
