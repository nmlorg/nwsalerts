        "description": "At 247 PM EST, the heavy rainfall that resulted in 1-2 inches of\naccumulation across southeastern Mecklenburg and western Union\ncounties this morning ended abruptly as stronger thunderstorms\ndeveloped south and east of the area. Fortunately, these\nthunderstorms intercepted the abundant moisture streaming into the\nregion and caused the ongoing moderate showers across the area to\nend before more widespread nuisance flooding developed.\nNevertheless, several area streams are just now cresting from the\nexcessive runoff so the Flood Advisory will be continued to allow\narea streams to crest and begin their recession.\n\nOnly light showers are expected through this afternoon and early\nevening; therefore, any nuisance flooding from the heavy rainfall\nthat occurred this morning is expected to diminish by the time the\nFlood Advisory expires later this afternoon.\n\nAdditional rounds of rainfall over saturated soils are expected\ntonight through early tomorrow morning which may cause new flooding\nto develop. People in the Charlotte metro area are advised to stay\nweather aware.\n\nSome locations that may continue to experience nuisance flooding\ninclude...\nMonroe, South Charlotte, Matthews, Mint Hill, Indian Trail,\nWeddington, Stallings, Unionville, Pineville and Wesley Chapel.",
        "instruction": "Heavy rainfall has caused ponding of water in urban areas, highways,\nstreets and underpasses, as well as other poor-drainage areas and\nlow lying spots. Do not attempt to travel across flooded roads. Turn\naround, dont drown.\n\nA Flood Advisory means river or stream flows are elevated and\nnuisance ponding of water in urban or other areas is likely.",
