        "description": "A developing winter storm system approaching from the mid-\nMississippi Valley will bring light snow for central Upper\nMichigan Saturday night. A very dry airmass northeast of Lake\nSuperior will bring in some very dry air to the lower and mid\nlevels of the atmosphere. This dry air will make the snow flake\nsize very small and combined with some gusty northeast winds, this\nwill cause very low visibilities in the light snow due to blowing\nand drifting snow. These strong northeast winds will have the\npotential to gust as high as 30 to 40 mph near the Lake Superior\nshoreline and along the Bay of Green Bay in southern Menominee\nCounty. The northeast Lake Superior snowbelts will see reduced\nvisibilities on Saturday.\n\nThe strong northeast winds could also cause minor lakeshore\nflooding and beach erosion late Saturday into early Sunday for\nlocations along Lake Superior from Marquette through Keweenaw Bay,\nand also along the Bay of Green Bay from Cedar River to Menominee.\n\nThose planning travel or recreational activities in Upper Michigan\nlater this weekend, need to stay tuned to the latest forecasts\nand updated statements on this low visibility light snow event.",
