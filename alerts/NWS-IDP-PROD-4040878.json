Although some light\naccumulation on grassy areas and elevated surfaces will be\npossible, temperatures range from 32-36 degrees across these\nareas, and widespread impacts to roadways are not expected at this\ntime.\n\nMotorists should exercise caution nonetheless, especially on rural\nbridges and overpasses, as a few slick spots cannot be entirely\nruled out.",
