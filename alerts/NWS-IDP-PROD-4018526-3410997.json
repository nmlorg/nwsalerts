Strong and gusty northwest winds\nwill develop over the entire area by early afternoon, leading to\nblowing and drifting snow. Blizzard conditions are likely for the\nopen and unsheltered areas of northeast Iowa and southeast\nMinnesota. If traveling, especially across southern Minnesota and\nnorthern Iowa, be prepared for dangerous whiteout conditions at\ntimes. In addition, rapidly falling temperatures will allow for\nany wet roads to freeze quickly this afternoon.\n\nThe National Weather Service in La Crosse has issued a Blizzard\nWarning, which is in effect until 6 PM CST this evening. The\nWinter Storm Warning is no longer in effect.\n\n* WHAT...Widespread blowing and drifting snow, with whiteout\nconditions at times. Periods of light snow continuing as well,\nwith any additional accumulation less than one-half inch.\nNorthwest winds gusting to 40 mph into late afternoon.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of southeast Minnesota and northeast Iowa.\n\n* WHEN...Until 6 PM CST this evening.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on dangerous travel conditions with significantly\nlowered visibility, particularly for open and unsheltered areas\noutside of towns. Wind chills as low as 20 below zero tonight\ncould cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 30\nminutes.",
