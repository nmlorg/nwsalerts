        "description": "Icy spots may develop on area roads tonight and persist into\nMonday morning in parts of western Nevada, which received up to\nan inch of snow Sunday afternoon and evening. If the snow melted\nbut has not yet dried, patches of ice could form as road surface\ntemperatures drop below freezing, resulting in hazardous travel\nconditions overnight and early Monday. This includes areas around\nFernley and Wadsworth, and also Fallon and Lovelock. Icy spots\ncould also develop from Minden to Topaz Lake, and across the Smith\nand Mason Valleys in southern Lyon County from the snow which fell\nmainly after sunset.\n\nIn addition, snow showers are possible off Pyramid Lake through\nthe night. This could rapidly lower the visibility on Interstate\n80 around Wadsworth and Fernley and make travel hazardous.\n\nAnyone venturing out tonight or early Monday morning should use\nextreme care as icy spots may be hard to recognize at night.",
