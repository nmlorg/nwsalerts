        "instruction": "Rip currents are powerful channels of water flowing quickly away\nfrom shore...which occur most often at low spots or breaks in the\nsandbar and in the vicinity of structures such as groins...\njetties and piers. For maximum safety...swim near a lifeguard.\nPay attention to flags and signs.\n\nIf you become caught in a rip current...yell for help. Remain\ncalm...do not exhaust yourself and stay afloat while waiting for\nhelp. If you have to swim out of a rip current...swim parallel to\nshore and back toward the beach when possible. Do not attempt to\nswim directly against a rip current as you will tire quickly.",
