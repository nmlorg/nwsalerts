        "description": "Precipitation is starting to develop over the North Carolina\nmountains this evening. Although temperatures will initially be\nabove freezing, with just rain across much of the area, the\nfalling precipitation is expected to cool the atmosphere, with\nnear-freezing temperatures developing in locations along and east\nof the Blue Ridge escarpment overnight. Affected areas will\ninclude Black Mountain, Little Switzerland, Jonas Ridge, Upton,\nand nearby locations. This will result in spotty freezing rain\nand light ice accumulations in these areas, with any icing\nexpected to remain mostly confined to elevated surfaces.\nTemperatures are expected to warm above freezing by around\ndaybreak, allowing precipitation to change back to rain.",
