        "description": "A cold front will bring below normal temperatures to the\nPanhandles starting early Tuesday morning. Wind chills will be in\nthe single digits in the northwest by day break Tuesday. Cold\nwind chills will continue each morning through Thursday morning\nfor all of the combined Panhandles. Wednesday morning will be the\ncoldest with wind chills near or below zero across the western\nPanhandles. Hypothermia and frostbite can set in quickly under\nthese conditions, especially if skin is exposed to the elements.\n\nThe system bringing this cold front will also have the potential\nto bring accumulating snow to portions of the combined\nPanhandles. Two rounds of snow are expected, with the first round\nexpected in the west and northwest late tonight into Tuesday\nafternoon. Accumulating snowfall of 1 to 3 inches will be\npossible in the northwestern combined Panhandles with the first\nround. For the second round, a band of heavier snow is expected to\nform Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning. The far southern\nTexas Panhandle is expected to be right on the northern edge of\nthis band, which increases uncertainty with snowfall amounts.\nRight now, we expect that 1 to 3 inches will be possible with\nlocally higher amounts, with values increasing further south near\nPlainview to Lubbock to Wichita Falls.",
