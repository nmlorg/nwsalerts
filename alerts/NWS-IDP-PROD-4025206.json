Visibilities have been reduced to one quarter to one\nhalf of a mile in some areas, especially around the Queen Isabella\nCauseway. The fog will dissipate as daytime heating increases\nallowing conditions to improve steadily.\n\nInexperienced mariners, especially those operating smaller\nvessels, should use caution while navigating in these conditions.\nVisibilities may change dramatically over short distances. If you\nmust navigate, proceed with caution. Use proper fog signals. Make\nsure all running lights are on.",
